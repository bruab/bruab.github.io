title: Marketing Your Website Sucks (the book)
---

This page is a chronological record of my efforts to sell my first book, [Your Website Sucks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7). My intention is to market the book actively until it's sold 1,000 copies.

Current sales: 60 copies. (37 on Gumroad, 23 on Amazon)

Here's what I've done:

## Pre-publication (2021-2022)

### Social media

I spent a ton of time and energy on ad platforms—Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn, and a bit of Instagram. I made short videos about the concepts and topics from my book.

Reception was ... somewhere between warm and tepid. I reached a nonzero number of people who found the content useful, and a handful who expressed interest in the book, but the effort didn't seem worth the benefit. I'm not convinced that an appreciable number of humans buy a book based on a TikTok. And there's the whole thing about [social media making people miserable](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/don-t-let-social-media-make-you-miserable), so I gave up on this approach more or less at the moment I published the book. No regrets :)

### YouTube

I've made a [bunch of videos](https://www.youtube.com/@briandavidhall) on my book topic. Extremely low viewership, and I got tired of talking about it. But I'm still on YouTube, because I like it there—I just stopped focusing on a single topic. I don't consider this to be a key part of my marketing strategy.

### Niche List 2021

I published a [book on niches](https://gum.co/niche-list) and sold a few hundred copies!

### Newsletter

After declaring that I'd never write newsletters again, I started writing a newsletter again. I imported folks who bought Niche List 2021 or subscribed to my previous newsletters, and I personally invited people in my network to subscribe. By the time I published, the list was at about 300 subscribers.

## Publication

### Publication on Gumroad (December 2022)

While still fiddling with the paperback cover of my book, I uploaded a PDF to Gumroad and announced it to my newsletter (and a few people on Slack). It sold 16 copies that week.

### Publication on Amazon (February 2022)

I finally got the book listed on Amazon and announced _this_ to my email list. I sold 15 copies that week.

## Post-publication

### Guest podcast appearance (March 2023)

I appeared on the [Freelance Podclass](https://www.freelanceu.com/freeupodcast/website-set-up-class/) to talk about websites for freelancers. (In general, I'm focusing on framing the general lessons of the book for specific audiences.)

I offered listeners a [free course](https://gum.co/freelance-website-blueprint) and a few have signed up. Maybe some will buy the book at some point. Overall, though, I found the coordination and pressure of recording an interview to be pretty draining, so I decided to focus on writing guest blog posts instead.

### Listing ebook on non-Kindle marketplaces (March 2023)

I used Draft2Digital to list my book on [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/id6446703556) and [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/your-website-sucks-brian-david-hall/1143252488;jsessionid=9E6A7C270BD882C045BD53C6715565F2.prodny_store01-atgap16?ean=2940166936639), plus a few places I've never even heard of: [Rakuten Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/your-website-sucks), [Smashwords](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1367956), Tolino, Borrow Box.

### Flesh out book website (April 2023)

I made some updates to [yourwebsitesucks.fyi](https://yourwebsitesucks.fyi/) to make it more conversion-friendly, so I can link to it in guest blog posts.

### Guest blog post (April 2023)

I published a post on [Accounting Today](https://www.accountingtoday.com/opinion/how-to-optimize-your-website-for-leads). The book website saw about 15 visits in the two weeks after publication.

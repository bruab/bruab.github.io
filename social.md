I'm not on social media, in an effort to be [less miserable](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/don-t-let-social-media-make-you-miserable).

I do still share videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@briandavidhall).

Feel free to stop by any of these places, but don't hesitate to [contact](/contact) me directly.

Here, for the record, are a few platforms I no longer actively use:

- Marketing [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@bdh.wtf), where I posted conversion + analytics tips
- Personal [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@brian.david.hall), where I occasionally posted about growing and cooking food
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briandavidhall/), where I generally sought to be annoying
- [Tumblr](https://briandavidhall.tumblr.com/), not sure what I was trying to do there. Share photos?
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/briandavidhall/), where I nerdposted, sermonposted, and shitposted on pretty much everything but partisan politics and sports

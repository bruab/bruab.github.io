I'm not on social media, in an effort to be [less miserable](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/don-t-let-social-media-make-you-miserable). (I [took a break](/taking-a-break-from-social-media/) and realized I just didn't want to go back.)

Don't hesitate to [contact](/contact) me directly, or show up at a [coworking session](/social-pomodoros) and ask me about it.

I'm only active on two platforms, in an effort to be [less miserable](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/don-t-let-social-media-make-you-miserable):

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/briandavidhall/), where I nerdpost, sermonpost, and shitpost on pretty much everything but partisan politics and sports
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@briandavidhall), same as the above but in vlog format

Feel free to stop by any of these places, but don't hesitate to [contact](/contact) me directly.

Here, for the record, are a few platforms I no longer actively use:

- Marketing [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@bdh.wtf), where I post conversion + analytics tips
- Personal [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@brian.david.hall), where I occasionally post about growing and cooking food
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briandavidhall/), where I generally seek to be annoying
- [Tumblr](https://briandavidhall.tumblr.com/), not sure what I'm doing there just yet

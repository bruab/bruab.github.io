Somehow, I'm on a bunch of social media platforms:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/briandavidhall/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, where I nerdpost, sermonpost, and shitpost on pretty much everything but partisan politics and sports
- Marketing [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@bdh.wtf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, where I post conversion + analytics tips
- Personal [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@brian.david.hall){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, where I occasionally post about growing and cooking food
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briandavidhall/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, where I generally seek to be annoying
- [Tumblr](https://briandavidhall.tumblr.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, not sure what I'm doing there just yet

Not sure if it counts as social media, but there's also
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7Tdfq87gF7atPHzGRb99A), where I share longer form videos on marketing, conversion optimization, and personal vlogs

Feel free to stop by any of these places, but don't hesitate to [contact](/contact) me directly.

If you'd like a copy of my book, [Your Website Sucks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7), but don't want to buy it, I'm open to trade offers. Send me a copy of _your_ book, or a book you think I should read, or some saffron from your garden, whatever.

Credit where credit's dueâ€”I got this idea from Malcolm Harris, who apparently traded a copy of his book for a dragon action figure:

{% include image.html url="/images/palo-alto-barter.png" alt="screenshot from twitter, dragon action figure on a bookcase" %}

(I'm not super into action figures, and at the same time I don't think I could refuse such an offer.)

To take me up on this, just send me an email, or hit Reply on a message I've sent you. Let me know what you propose to trade. Be specific or be mysterious; I'll probably just say yes.

(If you don't have my email address and I've never sent you a message, sign up below.)

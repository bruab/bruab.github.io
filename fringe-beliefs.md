Here are some things I believe, even though I also believe that it's weird to believe them. 

I'm open to having my mind changed! [Really](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/keep-track-of-things-you-change-your-mind-about). If you disagree, and want to talk about it, don't hesitate to [reach out](/contact).

**1. SARS-CoV-2 is dangerous, and avoidable, and worth avoiding.** 

As of 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer considered a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization, and the president of the United States has stated that it's over. But people still contract the virus, and some of them get sick. Some die, some stay sick for a long time. I believe that's bad and a thing we should try to avoid, so I minimize time spent in public indoor spaces, and wear an N95 respirator around others.

I also believe we should invest in ventilation and filtration, and reimagine as many human activities as possible so they take place outdoors. It'd be super cool to meet more people who agree! I don't know many.

**2. Large language models are not particularly useful.** 

I won't claim they have _no_ valuable applications. That would be impossible to prove. But for all of the use cases I've seen demonstrated so far, my only reaction has been "[This does not solve an actual problem](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/technology-doesn-t-necessarily-solve-a-real-problem)."

I believe that OpenAI has a fantastic public relations arm (and a massive PR budget). I believe that people on the internet gain clout and signal their forward-thinking, tech-savvy in-group belonging when they share how amazing ChatGPT is, or how it has revolutionized their process. But I don't believe that a plausible-but-consistently-incorrect text generator is particularly useful in doing any work worth doing.

**3. Everyone deserves clean water, healthy food, cozy shelter, and enough leisure time to make [weird art](/weird-art).** 

This isn't necessarily a controversial thing to say, but I think it makes a better starting point for organizing society than economic growth, or the tenets advanced in some ancient document, or individual freedom, or whatever else you might cherish. I'll go far as to say that economic growth, or ancient wisdom, or individual freedom aren't worth much at all if priortizing them doesn't provide us all with these four things. What do you think?

The book's _extremely rough_ right now but once I've done a couple revisions and convinced myself it's ... let's say, 80% coherent ... I'll send you an email with a link to the manuscript.

While you wait, here's a fun fact from the book:

Rolling Stone magazine had the following to say about Jimi Hendrix's first album:

> Jimi is neither a great songwriter nor an extraordinary vocalist
>
> ... the poor quality of the songs and the inanity of the lyrics too often get in the way
> 
> ... inartistically violent

The same magazine now lists the same record as the #30 best album OF ALL TIME.

If you've received criticism for your own work lately, please consider that even if you'd produced "greatest of all time" caliber work, _someone_ out there was bound to find fault with it.

I used to offer several courses and a book for free, but now they all cost "pay what you want."

So, for example, $1. For all of them. Every [course](/courses) I've made and every [book](/book) I've written or am currently writing, plus a lifetime subscription to [coTODO](/cotodo) assuming I actually ship it.

More info and a payment link on my [support](/support) page. Thanks for considering!

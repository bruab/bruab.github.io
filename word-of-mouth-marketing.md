title: Word of mouth marketing
---

Word of mouth marketing is the best kind of marketing imaginable. 

It's free, it scales exponentially, and it's powerful enough to overcome many of the objections, hesitation, and points of friction that might slow down or stop potential customers who find you by other means.

That said, it's not something you hear much about in digital marketing. There are a ton of courses, books, podcasts, agencies, and practitioners focused on SEO, social media strategy, running ads, or optimizing your website for conversions (hey that's me! ðŸ‘‹). But when's the last time you read a LinkedIn post or heard a conference talk on "word of mouth strategy"?

There's not a ton of useful info out there, but here's a collection of the good stuff I've found.

## Write Useful Books - Rob Fitzpatrick on recommendable fiction

It says it right there in bold on the book's [Amazon sales page](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0983HFQX7):

> The goal of book marketing is to stop needing to do it

(When's the last time _any_ marketing practicioner told you their goal was for you to stop needing their services?)

According to Rob in [this interview](https://youtu.be/MwQgj3JIsxE?t=273), the secret to book recommendability is to 

- Identify a problem that is "sharp enough that people will verbalize their suffering" from it
- Write a book that is the best-in-class solution to that problem

This seems generalizable beyond books! Whatever you're selling (services, SaaS, products), if it solves a painful problem _that people talk about_, you can expect existing/past customers to recommend it.

This recommendation loop may or may not be enough to displace all other marketing activity. It's important to note that Rob sees this as the optimal approach to _book_ marketing because there's a ceiling on how much you can charge for a book. Paid search advertising with an average cost per action of $75 might be a great approach if you sell services packages in the multiple thousands of dollars. But if you pay $75 in ads to get someone to buy your $9.99 book ... you're [tithing to google](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/cut-your-ads-budget).

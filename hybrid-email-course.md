title: Hybrid email course
---

... is just a phrase I made up to describe email courses that feature a hybrid approach to (a) automation and (b) means of delivery.

## Semi-automated

A hybrid course has automated steps, like "enter your email in the form, confirm your address, get the first email" or "get a message if you haven't progressed for X days."

But it also hinges on me, personally, typing some of the responses and moving students along in the sequence. Which allows me to launch courses and build them as we go.

## Mostly email, but

Some lessons live on my website, some are videos, and some courses are supplemented by (optional) accountability sessions.

Email holds everything together, but the course is more than a series of emails. Think of it like this:

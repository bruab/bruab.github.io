Here's info on all the affiliate deals I've got going.

## Calyx Institute

Use [this link](https://members.calyxinstitute.org/r/jixkd) and get 1 free month! I replaced my Spectrum cable internet with a Calyx mobile hotspot and couldn't be happier. The service is more reliable, it's far cheaper, and my money goes to a nonprofit.

## Fathom Analytics

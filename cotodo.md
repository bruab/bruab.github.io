**The todo app that will finally fix you.**

But seriously. I am building a dead simple todo app that will do the two things I actually find useful when it comes to productivity and task management:

- Keep me accountable to an Actual Human when I miss a deadline
- Help me celebrate what I've gotten done (rather than perpetually remind me of what I've yet to do)

If you'd like early access, [support my work](/support) at _any_ level and receive lifetime access.

Airtable has a nice one:

It's attractive and "shows the product" (so you know you're in the right place) without distracting.

Shopify also achieves attraction without distraction:

This is key, because lots of login pages are too busy.

Like Voxer (which asks for microphone permissions and invites you to download the app:

... or BrowserStack, which advertises new features, a discount offer, and has a prominent "Free Trial" button that presumably no login page visitors need to click:

Each example - even the distracting ones - does show a clear hierarchy of options. For Airtable, Shopify, and Voxer, I assume most accounts use email to log in, so that's the topmost element, set apart from other login methods. (For BrowserStack, hopefully Google Sign-in is more common than email.)

The very best example I've seen is Nextdoor:

It's branded, but spare. There's a clear hierarchy ("email first").

But the thing that sets it apart from Airtable and Shopify is the inclusion of the password field.
 
When this is hidden by default, users with a password manager are forced to follow a two-step process - auto-fill the email, click the button, then auto-fill the password and click again.

With Nextdoor it's done in one click.

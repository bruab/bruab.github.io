title: Scammy landing page that probably works
---

As much as I hate it, this "Officeless Agency Masterclass" landing page probably converts.

[![full page screenshot of officeless agency masterclass landing page](/images/officeless-agency-masterclass.png)](/images/officeless-agency-masterclass.png)

It's got:

- Lots of bolded and colored text
- A picture of a pile of dollar bills
- Arbitrary numbers - **5194** people have generated up to **$9,450** a month ðŸ™„
- A phony "countdown timer" at the bottom
- It makes the kind of promise that desperate people will convince themselves to believe in

The only difference between this and the archetypical "scammy landing page" in my head is that these pages are typically _much_ longer. 

If you've got a good example of a _long_ scammy landing page, please [send it my way](/contact).

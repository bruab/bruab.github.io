Those cutesy little "slide-or-fade-in" CSS effects on your homepage are pointless.

All they mean is that someone who wants to read your content has a slightly harder time than they should. They can't just scroll and scan, they have to scroll ... wait for your cutesy animation ... and then scan.

But I've found an example where I think these flourishes are actually appropriate. On the Slavery Footprint site, there are only two things you can do: read or take a survey.

If you choose to read, the animations serve to slow you down deliberately, because the text is short, and it's not meant to be scanned. Here's what it looks like:

<a href="https://d.pr/v/mWHBz8"> <img src="/images/animation-on-scroll.png"> </a>

So, I'll walk back my position on this, just a bit. If you have a section of your site where the only action available is to read (not skim or scan!), you may use animations. Otherwise, please get rid of them.

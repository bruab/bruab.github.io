Calendly's homepage is text-only above the fold:

No idea if these perform better than generic stock images or weird flat SaaS people, and maybe the copy could be improved. 

But personally, I'm a fan of leaving out images that take time to load, distract attention, and do nothing to help visitors learn or solve their problems 👏.

Outreach gets a bad rap.

Understandably, considering all the tone deaf emails junking up your spam folder.

But when practiced with deliberation and authenticity, outreach will transform your life and your business.

If you're willing to try out that point of view, consider signing up for a [coworking session](https://lu.ma/long-game).

Then read the [manifesto](/long-game-outreach-manifesto).

Then sign up to get a short weekly update on my research and experiments in outreach and beyond. I'll share scripts, strategies, and success stories.

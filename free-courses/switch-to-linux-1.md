title: [STL1] Decide on a distro

Thanks for signing up! (And confirming your email and all that stuff.)

Our first milestone is "deciding on a Linux distribution"â€”because it's open source, anybody can make their own version of it, and there are several to choose from.

So as a first step toward that goal, please go back to the "First lesson" email I sent you (or any email I've sent you), hit Reply, and let me know:

- What operating system are you currently using?
- What makes you want to switch (or at least think about switching)?
- What apps do you use on a daily/weekly basis?

If you've got any questions, feel free to throw those in, too.

Once I hear from you I will send a few options, and we'll be on our way.

Look forward to hearing back!

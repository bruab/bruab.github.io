title: I will help you switch to Linux
---

**Note:** This offer never took off, so I removed the signup form. Just [get in touch](/contact) if you want to try it :)

In this [hybrid email course](/hybrid-email-course), I'll troubleshoot, coach, and commiserate until you're able to use Linux for (most of) your daily computing needs.

## Why switch?

Good question. If you're totally happy with your current operating system, you should stick with it.

But maybe you're a Windows user who feels a little creeped out by their latest ["AI" features](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-surface-copilot-qualcomm-recall-ai), or annoyed by the [ads they put in your Start menu](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24138949/microsoft-windows-11-start-menu-ads-recommendations-setting-disable).

Maybe you're a Mac user who's had enough of the iCloud upsells and ads for Apple TV+, News+, Arcade, Apple Music, and Card in your Settings. Maybe their [branding makes you cringe](https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/apple-apologizes-ipad-pro-crushed-ad-it-missed-mark/2559321?ftag=MSF0951a18) these days. Or you're just disturbed by the whole [child labor](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-knowingly-used-child-labor-supplier-3-years-cut-costs-2020-12) thing and want to spend your money elsewhere.

Maybe you're interested in using an operating system and applications that don't get arbitrarily updated—whether they need it or not—every year, for the sake of generating sales and press. (I'm typing this blog post in a text editor that was released in 1991.) Maybe you're just enough of a nerd that Linux just sounds kind of fun!

If so, you should give it a try, and I want to help you.

## Why do I want to help you?

I'm supremely disappointed by the direction our biggest tech conglomerates are taking, and I want to fight for a world where computing and the internet are about more than maximizing ad impressions. Using an open source operating system like Linux is a way to do so. The more the merrier.

## How does this work?

We'll exchange a few messages about your needs and preferences, figure out what kind of hardware you have access to, and pick a Linux distribution. Then you'll install it and start using it. I'll help you get the programs you need, learn where to get answers, and provide tips & encouragement. We'll track milestones like "went one whole day without using your old operating system" and, eventually, "fully migrated."

Thanks for signing up! (And confirming your email and all that stuff.)

We have to tackle "meaningful" before we start improving, so please Reply with two things:

1. A link to your website
2. The main thing you want people to do when they visit

I realize it's possible to have several goals for your siteâ€”that's fine, but for now try to pin down the one that matters most.

This is usually something like:

- Make a purchase
- Fill out a contact form
- Book a meeting
- Download a thing
- Sign up for a thing

Once I hear from you I will take a look and respond with some suggestions. With any luck that will take us from 0/3 meaningful improvements (current status) to at least 1/3.

Look forward to hearing from you!

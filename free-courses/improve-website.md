## What's "meaningful"? What's an "improvement"?

Good question. I just mean "a change that makes things better in a way that matters."

But what's "better" and what "matters"?

Ultimately, I'll let you be the judge, but here are a few guidelines you might follow:

- The change addresses an issue on a key page (high traffic and/or high intent)
- The issue in question can be verified with visitor data or user testing
- The improvement can be verified with visitor data or user testing

_Or_

- It's simply obvious (to you) that the issue is important, and it's equally obvious (to you) that you're making a change for the better

The details depend on what kind of site you have, and what kind of goals and challenges you're facing. Join the course and we'll sort it out!

## Why is this free?

I've written a [book on this topic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7), and I want to sell more copies, because [books are the only thing I sell](/i-just-sell-books/). So if I'm able to help you, I'll gently invite you to buy a copyâ€”or, if you're extremely pleased, maybe buy two copies and give one to a friend.

Once at least 1,000 people have bought my book _and found it useful_, I hope it will keep reaching new readers through word of mouth. But for now, I have to [work](/marketing-your-website-sucks-book/) to make those sales happen. This is me doing the work!

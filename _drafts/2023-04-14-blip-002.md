This blew my mind: names (as we know them) have only existed for [TODO ... a few hundred?] years.

- i bought briandavidhall.com domain bc couldn't get brianhall.com or brian.com
- for most of human history i woulda just been brian, or at this point maybe bald brian or brian that brings eggs
- prehistory: TODO IDK?
- how names came about, note seeing like a state
- conclusion: who cares lol? TODO

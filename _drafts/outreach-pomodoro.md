Every Wednesday in June 2024, I'll be hosting a short working session focused on outreach for the purpose of finding freelance work.

We'll meet for ~30 minutes, starting at 1pm US-Eastern. Here's the agenda:

0:00 Settle in, say hello
0:05 Immediate circle. Is there anybody you know who *doesn't* know you're looking for work?
0:10 Peers. Who do you know who might already be working with your next client?
0:25 Say goodbye, close the tab

The meetings will take place in Gather, which is itself pretty cozy.

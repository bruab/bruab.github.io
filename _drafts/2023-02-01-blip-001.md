Hi there. It's X days (March 20) from projected last frost date here in the deep south, which is a relief. Fun fact about houses built in 1880, they are difficult to keep warm.

Another fun fact about houses from that era, at least around here: They have magnificent porches. And for the last couple months, I've been serving croissants and coffee on the front porch every Saturday.

It might sound like a casual event (I _hope_ it does), but in fact it's been painstakingly designed to meet some challenging requirements.

For one: There's no booze. I like booze and even [brew it myself](https://eufaula.biz/beer), but I don't want people getting intoxicated at my house and driving home. They could cause a car accident (an extremely recent innovation):

For most of humankind's time on earth, the only damage a drunk traveler could do would be to fall off their horse—which is dangerous, and can be fatal. But motor vehicles allow us to scale up the death toll by [two orders of magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_disasters_by_death_toll#Road).

Some other design decisions: It's outdoors (because pandemic) but can't be rained out. It's casual, recurring, consistent—always okay to stop by, always okay to skip it. It requires no serving dishes or utensils, so cleanup is easy. And, crucially, it's the only place in town where you can get croissants.

You _could_ buy them at Wal-mart, of course:

Grain grown and collected by a ginormous combine harvester, processed to remove the germ and the bran (and thus most of the nutritional value), then enriched to add a few nutrients back. Shipped to a factory and formed into a dough by underpaid humans and heavy machinery. Baked, wrapped in a clear plastic box made of fossil hydrocarbons that will remain on earth for another [450 years](https://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/how-long-does-it-take-for-plastics-to-biodegrade.htm). Loaded onto a truck and driven here (also by fossil hydrocarbons), placed on a shelf and up for grabs at only $3.99.

A miracle of modern technology and supply chain sophistication. But they don't taste very good.

So my front porch on a Saturday morning is the one place in town where you can get a fresh baked croissant, made from scratch.

Which is _still_ a [miracle of (relatively) modern technology](/croissants-are-cutting-edge-technology/), even without the industrial ovens and uniform packaging.

speaking of that: croissant options

croissants probably never avail. here till last 50yrs or so, quality croissants probably never available here till now ;nails;

(... and now u can buy them? link to supper club? but fwiw this is an instance of dual invention, and now that a neighbor's at it i've pivoted to cheese danish)

history of croissant -> thats how special this shit is

how bout coffee? -> current state and history of coffee in general and here

coffee's older: since 1400s in mecca https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-coffee

and since 1600s in the us https://blog.publicgoods.com/a-brief-history-of-coffee-in-america/

still: i make the good shit. single origin beans fresh burr ground and made in a chemex. can't get that here either unless you make it yourself, or show up on my porch

last up: hanging out. it's weirdly uncommon.

> On an average day 20 years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Time Use Survey, 38 percent of Americans socialized or communicated with friends. By 2021, that number was down to 28 percent.

so is leisure time for that matter (citation needed)

conclusion: come by my thing or do your own. if you already do, plz share

"The present moment is all we have," the gurus will tell us. And they're right of course, but can we get some acknowledgement for just how _weird_ a moment it is?

todo blip premise via - the device you're reading on and the infra that sent it

todo and the guy who sent it, and what he does

todo zoom in on the local: barbour, and hint at a couple challenges

todo if you were hoping for answers, sorry && musta overdid the copywriting on the signup page. but what i will do is share what i'm doing about *waves hand* all this. the efforts my wife and i are making locally. and i'll put in time to find the others (/long-game) and share what they're up to.

And if you're reading this: _You're the others_. What work are you doing, what ideas do you have to ensure the well being of the young people who will outlive us, and the ones who will (hopefully) be born a thousand years from now?

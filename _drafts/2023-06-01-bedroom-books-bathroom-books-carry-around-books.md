As part of an effort to spend less time staring at screens, I'm weaning myself off my smartphone.

First I removed social media apps, then I [took a break from social media](/taking-a-break-from-social-media), then I [quit social media altogether](/social).

But I still look at my phone all the time. I pick it up, open a web browser, and read recent tweets from writers I used to follow.

It's more deliberate than mindlessly scrolling an algorithmic feed, sure, but it's also not how I want to spend my life.

So far, every time I've reduced screen time, app usage, or digial distractions, there's been an immediate sense of relief and increased energy. I've got no reason to believe I've hit a point of diminishing returns, not yet. Next challenge: Can I replace my scrolling habit with a reading habit?

To do so, I'll need to make reading approximately as easy and enjoyable as taking my phone out of my pocket. To do that, I'll select and place books in the locations where I most often take out my phone.

Imagine you've got dreams of becoming a fashion designer. It seems natural to study others who have succeeded in the field, so you start searching and come across this video:

This guy is living the dream, and it sounds so simple!

> You can do whatever you want to do in life, but just make sure you do it well, and you do it with passion.

Words to live by. Seems like all you need to do is get good at designing while retaining your passion. You got this!

Now imagine 20 years go by and you still haven't realized the dream of having your own clothing line, a team of specialists working for you, and your own snappy sizzle reel with which to inspire others.

You're confused and disappointed, so you retrace your steps. Was there something you missed when studying your idol?

A bit of digging and ... _there_ it is! One factor that Wyatt didn't mention in his video, but which may have had some bearing on his success, was that his dad is a billionaire who literally [built and owns his own town](https://www.denverpost.com/2012/08/19/billionaire-bill-kochs-new-colorado-town-is-a-private-old-west-marvel/). Maybe that helped; maybe it helped even more than Wyatt's passion.

Looks like you've fallen victim to [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).

That sucks. But don't feel bad: It happens to all of us, all the time.

In fact, **there is no way to overcome, avoid, or even adequately account for survivorship bias.**

It's a data problem. Imagine compiling the stories of every human who ever dreamt of becoming a fashion designer. The hundreds of millions who promptly abandoned the goal to pursue something else. The tens of millions who spent some time and energy pursuing it before giving up. The millions who are actively striving for success right now.

Now imagine giving each of those stories the same amount of attention that I just forced you to give Wyatt Koch. Even if you could _collect_ all that data (and you can't), it would take lifetimes to consume it.

Given this imbalance, the rather drastic strategy of "deliberately ignoring all success stories" would only partially mitigate the noise in the data. You're still exposed, and you're still biased.

- what u can do about it
  - ignore success stories, except when balanced with failure
    - watch out tho: The [Mikkelsen Twins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biYciU1uiUw) will tell you about how they were directionless and burnt out before they discovered the secret to success
  - focus on skills
  - do something unintelligible

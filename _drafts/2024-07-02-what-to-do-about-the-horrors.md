If u dk what i mean idk read something else? if you know but are curious about the def it's at the bottom but that's not the important part, the important part is _what do you do about the horrors_?

2nd paragraph stilla in't told you so here it is: Find where your energy supports and increases the horrors, and redirect that energy. (then help others do the same)

start w requirements for life: water, food,

instead of working for evilcorp 40hrs a week and spending your paychecks on products made by evilcorp, then doing a really rightous post on social media ... how about withdraw your labor, or money, from evilcorp. or some of it.

...

"Organize" ok if u know what that means i guess go do it, get in touch lmk how it works out, but idk what it means and hvae spent a lot of energy on little to no, or maybe negative progress. you can't just join an org an dmake everything okay

not just "buy organic" - the market is unlikely to have a drop-in "ethical" solution for you. it will be harder and weirder than that

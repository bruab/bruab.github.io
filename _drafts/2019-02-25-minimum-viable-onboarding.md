Onboarding!

Okay, maybe it's not actually that exciting. Especially to you - as an agency owner you've never _been_ onboarded. You likely can't even identify when your first day was.

It matters, though. Good onboarding saves you time, reduces churn, and increases employee productivity. You've got to do it, but it's hard to know where to start. That's what this guide is for. Good onboarding quickly communicates your agency's culture and structure - and is a self-sustaining process.

## Culture

From day one, you want your employees to feel confident that they've made the right choice, that they're in the right place. Communicating company culture is how you do it.

Start by writing a welcome letter. It should be in your voice. It shouldn't be anything elaborate. Tell your new hire how excited you are to have them, share a few notes about your agency's history and future.

Bonus points: Link to your agency's Mission, Vision, and Values. (If you haven't written those down anywhere, now's a great time to do that.)

This welcome letter should be an internal document, but there's nothing stopping you from sharing other cultural points - mission, vision, values, history, success stories - in public. On your blog or website. When you do this, you attract employees who are a good fit, filter out employees who aren't, and prevent surprises or regrets on everybody's first day.

## Structure

Once a new hire is confident that she belongs, she needs to know where she fits in and where all the stuff is.

She probably knows who she's reporting to, but who else is on the team? Where can she go for help? Where can she go for questions? Who's available for lunch?

Share an org chart and a document (or folder) with roles and responsibilities, along with suggestions for people to talk to during the first week.

One step better is to share your team's goals, OKRs, metrics, or whatever you use. This gives your new hire a _great_ glimpse into what's currently going on within the agency, helps her start thinking in terms of her own objectives, and communicates the type of expectations you have for everyone on the team.

Finally, share a simple guide to the tools you use day to day. What are your guidelines for using Slack? When should a conversation happen in a public channel vs DM ... vs email, vs in your project management software? Who's in charge of setting up accounts on all of these tools?

All of these questions might seem obvious to you, but for a newcomer it's never clear - and you don't want your employees using mental energy trying to guess where to ask questions when they could be executing on valuable work for your clients. Write it down, make it clear. This eliminates the risk that (a) she'll hound you all day with questions or (b) she'll get things wrong because she's _reluctant to ask questions_.

## It's alive!

With these documents - _first drafts_ of these documents - in place, the final step is to make sure that they become the property of everyone in the organization, and that updating the onboarding docs is _part of onboarding_. This saves you from having to continually update them.

How do you do this, though? First, be sure to call out the expectation in your welcome letter. Next, provide your new hire with an onboarding task or checklist within your project management system. This task should explicitly require updating the docs, even if only trivially.

Here's an example. Suppose in your Tools doc you mention "we encourage the addition of custom emoji to Slack - the most recently added was :mindblown:". In the onboarding checklist, add a step right after "Read Tools doc" that says "Add a custom emoji to Slack." After _that_, add a step that says "Update Tools doc with most recently added emoji."

This lets your new hire know that yes, she _really is expected to edit these docs_. Now that the floodgates are open, as a penultimate step in the checklist, ask her to (a) fix any typos she came across, and (b) _deliberately introduce_ a new typo in the docs.

The _final_ step should be to book a 1:1 with you - during which you'll admire her taste in emoji, and ask her where the typo is.

If this all seems a bit silly ... that's fine. But keep in mind that you don't know what it's like to be a new hire at your agency; you never will. So erring on the side of clear direction, even overcommunication, is a good thing. And starting with a few explicit tasks _that you immediately verify_ sets the precedent that you mean what you say, and hold employees accountable. Your new hires will appreciate this!

Now that your new employees are in charge of keeping your onboarding docs up to date, you just have to do is keep growing, keep hiring, and the rest will take care of itself. All you had to do was seed the process.

## Where to start

Here's what you can do today: sit down and write a draft of the welcome letter. It doesn't have to be perfect; eventually it will belong to the whole team and they'll make sure it's right. Just get started.

If that comes easily, the next step is to recruit a team member to help you put together the rest of the process. Pick somebody who naturally gravitates toward helping out new hires, a cultural champion, or just somebody you trust to get things done. Send them this article, sit down and talk through what you want your next hire's experience to be like, and get to work.

Let's talk about how I can help you get a book out into the world.

My [day job](https://www.usefulbooks.com/) involves helping authors plan, improve, complete, and publish nonfiction books, and [I write books myself](/books).

But there could be any number of reasons why you're not in a position to take on such a huge project yourself. That's no reason for your stories, insights, and ideas to be hidden from the world.

Publishing a book will change your life, guaranteed, and if you're reading this I want to urge you to make it happen. The only question is whether you want me to help.

Here are a few reasons you might decide to work with me:

- We'll craft your book for maximum impact on the reader, ensuring it's memorable and recommendable
- If your work is technical in nature, [I can handle that](/education)
- I [won't use AI](/why-i-wont-use-ai)

The first, zero-pressure step is an informal chat about your book idea. Memoir, instructional, an idea book, or a combination of the above? Who are your readers, and how do you want to change their lives?

[Get in touch](/contact) and let's discuss. If I'm not the right person for the job, I can introduce you to other talented folks. The main thing is that the idea that brought you to this page becomes reality.

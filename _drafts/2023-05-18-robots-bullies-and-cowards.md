Three types of beings you might meet on the internet right now.

## Robots

not really AI, AI is marketing, like web3 was marketing

## Bullies

These people revel in the idea of creative people losing their jobs to robots. They love it. They hear about writers going on strike and this their response:

{% include image.html url="/images/bully1.png" %}

Or maybe this:

> oh no. a writers strike. whatever shall we do. if only there was some kind of machine that could endlessly pump out textual content so we didn't have to rely on these flaky humans,,,

If you're reading this, it's extremely unlikely you're a bully. Bullies prioritize public displays of contempt for writers over, you know, reading. Bullies seek clout, and reading this post will not gain you any clout. (Sorry.)

There's a decent chance you belong in the third group, though.

## Cowards

Bullies are in the minority. They're greatly outnumbered by the cowards who prop them up.

Cowards accept the bullies' frame in order to to gain a little of the bullies' clout. They won't do a victory dance at the prospect of creative humans losing their income, but they'll discuss it as an inevitability. Terribly sad, but what can you do?

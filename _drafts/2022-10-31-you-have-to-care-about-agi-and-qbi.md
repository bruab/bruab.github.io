Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and Qualified Business Income (QBI) are two extremely boring values you (or your accountant) will calculate when filing your annual tax return. 

But they shouldn't stay buried in line 13 of your 1040. You should develop a mental model of where these numbers come from and how they determine how much you pay in taxes. And you should carry this mental model around with you for the rest of your life. It won't be as painful as it sounds.

## AGI - total income (more or less)

Your AGI is the sum of all your earnings:

- W-2 wages
- Interest and capital gains
- Gambling wins
- Alimony, jury duty compensation, and however else you got paid

... _minus_ a handful of adjustments:

- Self-employment tax deduction
- Self-employed health insurance deduction
- Student loan interest deduction
- And many more! see Part II of [the official form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s1.pdf)

why you care / what to do

## QBI - Your total business earnings (sort of)

Your QBI is what determines whether you're eligible for the QBI deduction, which can save you a bunch of money on your _personal_ income tax return.

It's not based on your taxable income - QBI is essentially your net business profit or loss, but there are some specifics to consider.

In particular, QBI doesn't include wage income or your "reasonable compensation" from your S-corporation, if you have one.

All the rules are [here](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8995){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

The main things to find out for your business are:

- Will my income be beneath (or within) the phase-out range? (In 2022 this was $164,900 for single / head of household)
- Is my QBI equivalent to my net profit / loss or do I have income or expenses that need to be excluded?

There's a question that is most often posed by grifters trying to sell you overpriced cans of textured vegetable protein or a "survivalist knife." It's also something you hear from unhinged podcast hosts, bloggers, and YouTube video personalities trying to maximize engagement via shock and fear.

It's a shame, because the question is actually a really good one, for reasons I'll soon demonstrate. But first, this is important:

- I do not have any meal rations or survival gear to sell you. (I [only sell books](/i-only-sell-books), and they're not about that)
- I don't want you to feel fear, or think that you should. I'm here to provoke curiosity and wonder

Okay, now for the question:

> If the globalized, fossil fuel-reliant system of economic production were to fail tomorrow, how would you live?

I get how it can provoke unease, and possible panic-buying of sardines, but I want to encourage you to sit with it for a few minutes. There's almost definitely a treat at the end of this exercise.

- ofc if it happens we all die or whatever
- think ab specific thing you do
- what would it look like if you could still do it?
- can u move in that direction now, and if you did would it be enjoyable
- different from "going back in time" bc preserving existing infra, tools, etc.
- examples - food, water, transportation, computing (?)

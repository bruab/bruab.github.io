Every Tuesday in June 2024, I'll be hosting a short Cozy tech check-in.

We'll meet for ~30 minutes, starting at 1pm US-Eastern. Here's the agenda:

0:00 Settle in, say hello
0:05 Wins. What's something you've recently discovered (or changed) about your relationship with technology that brings more coziness into your life?
0:15 Challenges. What's something you *want* to find, or change, or stop doing? 
0:25 Say goodbye, close the tab

The meetings will take place in Gather, which is itself pretty cozy.

# How to optimize your website for leads

- intro

- decide on your offer
  - probably "reach out"
  - but consider "book a call"
  - could be "download this resource" but be sure you can bring in clients via email

## Decide on your offer

"What can I do here?" This is one of the first things people try to figure out when they land on a website, and that includes future clients landing on _your_ site. Make their lives easier by making the answer as clear as possible.

This means thoughtfully choosing a single action that suits the majority of visitors, and making sure it's prominently displayed in multiple places on your site.

I've seen CPA websites with a jumble of big, bold buttons featuring unclear options: Pay Now, Suralink, Portal ... what do these buttons mean to a prospective client? Nothing. If you want your site to bring in new business, you need to offer an action that makes sense to prospects. Most likely one of the following:

- Contact us (fill out a form)
- Book a call

Which one should you choose? 

If you're looking to bring in as much business as possible, let visitors book a call directly from the website. That's likely a necessary step to becoming a client, so let them skip right to it.

If you need to filter out leads to avoid wasting time on unqualified prospects, have them fill out a form and follow up by phone or email.

In either case, once you've settled on your website's primary offer, you've still got work to do.

## Make it obvious, make it appealing

Put a button with this action in the top right corner of your site's navigation, and in the top section of your homepage. Include it where appropriate on other pages, and repeat it somewhere in the middle of longer pages.

Visitors won't be ready to book a call (or contact you) immediately after landing on your site. But they'll know that's the next step, and this knowledge helps them frame their journey. They don't need to learn everything about your practice in one visit—they just need to learn enough to decide if they want to take the action you're inviting them to take.

Speaking of which, how do you convince them to do so?

In a sense, everything on your site contributes toward this goal. Your case studies, blog posts, even your smiling face. But the biggest impact you can make is in framing the offer itself.

If it's "Contact us"—what kind of followup should they expect, and how soon? What will you do with the information they submit in the form? (It's usually a good idea to state _explicitly_ that you will not share or sell their personal details.)

If it's "Book a call"—what questions will you answer during the call? What should they prepare before showing up, and what will they take away from the conversation? What hesitation might they feel about scheduling this conversation, and can you address them directly? (For example, by saying "This isn't a sales pitch. It's just a quick discussion to better understand your tax and financial situation.")



- make it obvious, make it appealing
  - this means, by default, eliminating clutter and popups and stuff
  - ask for only what you need and explain why you're asking


- test it in the wild
  - hallway usability testing
  - first click test
  - session recordings (?)
  - don't forget mobile
  - purpose is to uncover biggest issues that you can't see yourself, not make it perfect

what about

- talk about them, not you? (that's next level?)

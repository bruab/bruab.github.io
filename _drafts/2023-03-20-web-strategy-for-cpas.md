- decide on your offer
  - probably "reach out"
  - but consider "book a call"
  - could be "download this resource" but be sure you can bring in clients via email
- make it obvious, make it appealing
  - this means, by default, eliminating clutter and popups and stuff
  - ask for only what you need and explain why you're asking
- test it in the wild
  - hallway usability testing
  - first click test
  - session recordings (?)
  - don't forget mobile
  - purpose is to uncover biggest issues that you can't see yourself, not make it perfect

what about

- talk about them, not you? (that's next level?)

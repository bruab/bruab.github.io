# How to optimize your website for leads

Your website's copy and layout matter—that's why companies like Amazon, Google, and Bing conduct [thousands of experiments per year](https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments). Even a minor tweak in the layout or wording of a page can have an impact on visitor behavior.

Of course, those sites also have millions of visitors per day. Your firm doesn't have that luxury, but you can still make changes that improve your chances of converting site visitors into leads.

It all starts with prioritization: The top of the page is more important than what's at the bottom. Headings and buttons matter more than paragraph text. And the most important element of all is the specific action you ask visitors to take.

## Decide on your offer

"What can I do here?" This is one of the first things people try to figure out when they land on a website, and that includes future clients landing on _your_ site. Make their lives easier by making the answer as clear as possible.

This means thoughtfully choosing a single action that suits the majority of visitors, and making sure it's prominently displayed in multiple places on your site. This is your offer.

I've seen CPA websites with a jumble of big, bold buttons featuring unclear options: Pay Now, Suralink, Portal ... what do these buttons mean to a prospective client? Nothing. If you want your site to bring in new business, you need to offer an action that makes sense to prospects. Most likely one of the following:

- Contact us (fill out a form)
- Book a call

Which one should you choose? 

**If you're looking to bring in as much business as possible**, let visitors book a call directly from the website. That's a step they have to take before becoming a client, so let them skip right to it.

**If you need to filter out leads to avoid wasting time on unqualified prospects**, have them fill out a form. You can follow up by phone or email at your discretion.

In either case, once you've settled on your website's primary offer, you've still got work to do.

## Make it obvious, make it appealing

Regardless of which offer you choose, there are a few tried and true user experience (UX) principles worth your attention.

First of all, put a button with your call to action (CTA) in the top right corner of your site's navigation, and in the top section of your homepage. Include it where appropriate on other pages, and repeat it somewhere in the middle of longer pages.

Make sure these buttons stand out from the background of the page, and that they're large enough to tap, even on a small phone screen. 

Visitors won't be ready to book a call (or contact you) immediately after landing on your site. But when they see this repeated CTA, they'll know that's the next step. This knowledge helps them frame their journey. They don't need to learn everything about your practice in one visit—they just need to learn enough to decide if they want to take action.

Speaking of which, how do you convince them to do so?

In a sense, everything on your site contributes toward this goal. Your case studies, blog posts, even your smiling face. But the biggest impact you can make is in framing the offer itself.

### Optimizing "Contact us"

Motivating visitors to fill out a form is all about providing context and setting expectations.

What kind of followup should they expect, and how soon? What will you do with the information they submit in the form? (It's usually a good idea to state _explicitly_ that you will not share or sell their personal details.)

Be sure to remove distractions from the form page itself. Turn off your chat widgets and popups on this page. (You might consider turning them off everywhere, for that matter.) TODO_LINK

While you're at it, remove any form fields you don't need. Don't ask them to type their company name unless it's required for your followup. Don't ask for a phone number unless you plan to call them.

Compare the following two forms. Which one would you be more likely to fill out?

### Optimizing "Book a call"

Context and expectation-setting apply to this offer as well, but visitors will have different concerns.

What questions will you answer during the call? What should they prepare before showing up, and what will they take away from the conversation? What hesitation might they feel about scheduling this conversation, and can you address them directly? (For example, by saying "This isn't a sales pitch. It's just a quick discussion to better understand your tax and financial situation.")

Make sure the duration of the call is clear, as well. Most calendar solutions make this quite easy, but don't skimp on the "Event description" field! Consider the following two calendar booking widgets. Which one gets you motivated?

### Don't forget mobile

Once you've made these updates to your site, _be sure to  TODO ...

  - in either case
    - verify mobile experience
    - make sure it works lol

## Get feedback from actual humans

You could hire an agency and pay them tens of thousands of dollars to conduct usability studies on your website. But it's possible to uncover the biggest issues with a few quick rounds of informal user testing.

Here's how to do it:

- Find a friend, colleague, or a stranger in a cafe—someone who hasn't used your website before
- Recruit them: "I'm making some updates to my website and want to get an outsider's view. Can you spare 5 minutes to help out?"
- Prepare them: "Imagine you're looking for a CPA. You need someone who works with small businesses*. Visit this address, find out if it meets your needs, and if so, take the next step toward hiring me. Go slowly and share your thought process out loud (even if that seems a little weird)"
- Watch them: Let them navigate your site and talk through what they're doing. You'll learn a lot, and if there's any confusing language, or it's hard to find important information, you'll know it right away. You'll also be able to catch any friction with your signup or scheduling process

Do just 3-5 of these sessions, and you'll know what (if anything) needs fixing on your site. Once that's taken care of, you can relax, knowing that your website is working to bring in leads.

- test it in the wild
  - hallway usability testing
  - first click test
  - session recordings (?)
  - don't forget mobile
  - purpose is to uncover biggest issues that you can't see yourself, not make it perfect

what about

- talk about them, not you? (that's next level?)

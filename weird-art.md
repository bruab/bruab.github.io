We need more weird art.

If you disagree, I'd love to [talk](/contact) - to me this is a completely obvious and uncontroversial truth.

I don't have a rigorous definition for this term - it's a broad category.

Weird art sometimes takes the form of unnecessary flourishes on functional creations.

Whether you're building a [church](https://sagradafamilia.org/en/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}:

... or some [apartments](https://www.instagram.com/freddy_mamani_silvestre/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}:

... or just tricking out your [tuk tuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}:

Weird art can be performative. Like [sculpting topiaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Fryar){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}:

... or entering a [duck in a marathon](https://twitter.com/frozenaesthetic/status/1522467208584179713){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}:

The important thing about weird art is not its beauty, or originality, or value on the market.

What matters is the joy of expression that comes with creating it. (Bonus points if other people like it too.)

So when I say "we need more weird art" I don't mean we should build Weird Art Factories and optimize production.

I mean that everyone needs to make weird art - including you.

If you have made or are working on some weird art, I'd love to hear about it - just [reach out](/contact).

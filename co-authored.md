I feel like I'm forgetting something somehwere but I believe I've only co-authored one thing? It's a (now tragically dated) [Guide to Twitter](https://tasshin.com/blog/a-guide-to-twitter/) that I wrote with Tasshin.

It was a great experience. I'd like to do more of this. Want to write something together? Or even just try it?

Here's list of [topics](/topics) in case it helps. [Get in touch](/contact) and let me know what you'd like to write about. Hope to hear from you soon.

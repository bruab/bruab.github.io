Here's a listing of [cozyweb](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe) locales where you can find me:

- This website, of course, and my [newsletter](/newsletter)
- The various online [meetups](/meetups) I host
- The [Useful Authors community](https://www.usefulbooks.com/), where I commiserate with other writer types
- The [Freelance Friday Club](https://www.freelancefriday.club/), where I run a weekly video producers' coworking session
- SMS/phone - if we're not texting, but you'd like to, hit reply on one of my newsletters or book a [walk and talk](/walk-and-talk)
- RSS - I subscribe to and read a handful of feeds. Happy to share the list if anyone's curious - just [hit me up](/contact)

... and that's about it. I'm not active in any Slacks or Discords, I don't use Whatsapp.

I'd love to find a cozyweb corner to talk about bicycles, and permaculture, and lost crops. If you know of any, [let me know](/contact).

Ideas I'm actively tossing around:

- Try to mainstream the idea of [using OBS flourishes in standard, everyday Zoom calls](/lets-make-zoom-weird)
- Make an audio course on conversion optimization
- Make a podcast on the Tao of conversion optimization
- Make an interactive email course that (over time) delivers the entire contents of my first book ([Your Website Sucks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7)
- Sell [lost crop](/lost-crops) seed balls

Ideas I've cast aside (for now):

- Build a "learn to code + market yourself as a freelancer simultaneously by building a dev portfolio starting from zero" course
- Migrate off Google Workspace (impossible)
- Start a consulting business to help Amazon sellers stop selling on Amazon
- Build an open source food pantry map 
- Document nonfiction authors' tech stacks in a searchable one-page website

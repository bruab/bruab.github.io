I don't have one.

1000% not trolling you here; billing hourly just doesn't make sense to me. 

It doesn't mean I don't want to work together.

You can read more about why I don't work on an hourly basis [here](/blog/what-s-wrong-with-hourly), or you can just [reach out](/contact) and I'll be happy to chat.

(Heads up: my first question will be "What problem are you trying to solve?")

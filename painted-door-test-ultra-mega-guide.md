title: The Painted Door Test Ultra Mega Guideâ„¢

Okay, see what I did there?

I haven't actually written an ultra mega guide to painted door tests, but your click tells me that there may be some interest in such a thing..

(Or else just morbid curiosity.)

If this page gets enough visits, I'll create a product on Gumroad and open it up to presales, then change the button you clicked so it opens _that_ page instead of this one.

And if enough people purchase the presale, I'll write the guide.

Hope that makes sense, and doesn't seem too sneaky.

If you want to talk about such things please feel free to [get in touch](/contact)! I'd love to hear from you.

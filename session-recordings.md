Marketing technology is a wonder to behold.

You can literally _replay visits to your website_ in order to improve UX, increase conversions, make tons more money, etc. etc.

So cool! Only slightly creepy!

Except ... if you have any traffic at all, this approach DOES NOT SCALE. You can't watch every single visitor. You've got other things to do.

It would be amazing if you had a step-by-step guide to leverage this unique data source _without_ spending the best years of your life staring at a screen.

It would be super cool if that guide looked something like this:

Here are a few examples of people doing things I'd like to do.

## Compost

The [Compost Cooperative](https://thecompostcooperative.com/) in Greenfield, Massachussets provides residents with 5 gallon buckets to fill with food scraps, then picks up the buckets and delivers them to a local farm to be composted. The [Denver Compost Collective](https://denvercompostcollective.com/) is doing the same thing.

## Food rescue

Here are a few examples of organizations that pick up food that's headed for the trash can and redistribute it so it gets eaten:

- 
- [Philly Food Rescue](https://phillyfoodrescue.org/)
- [Boulder Food Rescue](https://www.boulderfoodrescue.org/) (bonus points: they do it on bicycles)
- More operations listed on the [Food Rescue Hero website](https://www.foodrescuehero.org/food-rescue-hero-network)

## Farming

Here are a few nearby farms growing food organically:

- [Hornsby Farms](https://hornsbyfarms.com/) in Auburn, AL is a small family farm. (Not sure how I feel about plasticulture ðŸ¤”)
- ???

## Lost crops

[Buckeye Seed & Supply](http://buckeyeseed.com/index.html) produces and sells goosefoot seeds. So does [PlantPassion777 on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/PlantPassion777?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=1155288161).

## Coffee

[Cafe Campesino](https://www.cafecampesino.com/) is a small coffee roaster in Americus, GA that gets their coffee from a [cooperatively owned and operated coffee importing organization](https://coopcoffees.coop/).

title: Fibonacci pricing

Fibonacci pricing refers to selling a thing at ever-increasing price points which correspond to the numbers of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence):

$0 (free), $1, $1, $2, $3, $5, $8, $13, $21, $34, $55, $89, ...

## Why would you do this?

As an experiment to figure out approximately how much people are willing to pay for the thing. As a way to reward your best customers (they hear about it first and get the best prices). As a metamodern marketing stunt to break the fourth wall.

## What exactly does it look like?

There are a couple of approaches.

- **By item:** The first item is free, the next two are $1 each, etc.
- **By day:** The item is free for one day, $1 for the next two days, $2 for the day after that, etc.
  - _Variation: Time period_ - instead of days, use weeks. Or hours.
  - _Variation: Sales required_ - instead of going up each day, the price goes up _the day after a sale is made at the previous price point._ So the item might carry a price tag of $13 for several days if nobody's buying; once someone does, it goes up to $21 the next day

## Where can I see examples?

I don't think there are any yet, but I'm working on one.

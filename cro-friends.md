If you happen to identify as someone who does Conversion Rate Optimization or Conversion Optimization or Customer eXperience Optimization or just Optimization or ... you know, whatever we're calling it - we should be friends.

I've been at this stuff for a long time (full story in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUavnQlT-LM)). There aren't that many of us. we should [connect](/contact). We can share tips, or commiserate about site updates breaking tests, or brainstorm new names for CRO, or just talk about pets/food/whatever.

Hope to hear from you soon ðŸ‘‹

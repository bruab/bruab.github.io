Here are the tools I use to do stuff:

- GitHub Pages - to host this site and [others](/sites)
- [Fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/BLQQDD) - to tell me where people go on this site and [others](/websites) (affiliate link ðŸ’°)
- UsabilityHub - for quick user research studies. ([See here](/affiliate-links) for coupon codes! You can get 10% off a subscription & 20 free testing credits)
- Canva - to design amazing YouTube thumbnails
- Droplr - to take & share screenshots, and to record [notes to myself](/vibes-based-project-management) & [website audits](/audits)
- Formspark - to add forms to this website
- Google Workspace - for docs, sheets, calendar, email (despite all my [beefs with Google](/beefs-with-google))
- ScreenFlow - for recording and editing videos
- Camo - Lets me use an old iphone with a cracked screen as a webcam
- Google Workspace mail merge - to send my [newsletter](/newsletter)
- Gumroad - to sell [books and courses](https://shop.briandavidhall.com/)
- Vellum - to do interior layout for [books](/books)
- Namecheap - to buy domain names which I sometimes use
- Zoom - for video calls. (I've tried and liked other tools, but everybody just gave me a hard time about not using Zoom)
- Excalidraw - for putting together quick and crude but cute wireframes
- iTerm - for editing text and running scripts. I spend more time in this app than any other, by far
- Firefox - to browse interwebs

Here's a little map of what stuff I store locally vs. on other people's computers (a.k.a. "the cloud").

(If the image makes your eyeballs bleed, the short version is "web hosting and email in the cloud, other stuff local.")

Here's the basic formula I use when writing sales pages.

---

Are you in `{situation}`? Do you have `{problem}`?

You'd probably really like it if you could just have `{desired outcome}`.

Well you're in luck, because `{product}` does just that.

Here's just a bit of info about how great it is.

But at this point you're probably thinking `{main objection}`.

Understandable, but consider this: `{reverse main objection}`.

Here's some more detail on what `{product}` looks like and how it works.

In fact, it works so great, it comes with a `{guarantee}`.

Here's _even more_ detail about it. Everything you could possibly need to make a decision.

And here are the different options/sizes available.

So, in summary, `{summary}`.

`{call to action}`

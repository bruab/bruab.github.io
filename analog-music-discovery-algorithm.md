title: Analog music discovery algorithm

Here's how it works:

- Take a look at this list of [music I love](/music-i-love) and pick something you also love
- Book a [coworking session](/coworking) with me

We'll meet, chat a bit, then do some work (in parallel) while listening to the album (in parallel).

Then we'll chat some more, until we discover an artist or album _I think you might like_ which _you have not heard_.

We'll book another coworking session and listen to that album. Maybe you'll like it! No pressure though.

At the end of _that_ session, it's your turn to suggest something I might like. 

We'll book a third coworking session to listen to it. (Maybe I'll like it! We'll see.)

At the end of all this, each of us will have shared something we like, tried something new, and gotten a few chunks of work done along the way. Hope to see you soon.

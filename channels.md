title: "Channels"

There was a time not long ago when "checking messages" for me meant logging in to my personal email, a few work emails, Notion, ClickUp, Airtable, half a dozen Slacks, a couple Discords, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Telegram, Signal, and Messages.

It was a bit much.

In an effort to simplify my life, reduce time spent staring at a screen, and limit the data I offer up for harvest, I'm seeking to reduce communications to just a few channels:

- SMS for urgent messages only
- Email and Signal for slowchats

I still use Slack, Notion, ClickUp, etc. for work, but I send all notifications to email. Having to jump between half a dozen UIs just to read updates is an absurd waste of cognitive power. Even if the UIs are beautiful!

I'm curious to hear how you manage comms in your own life. How many channels do you use, and how often do you check them? [Let me know](/contact).

(Or maybe you think I'm being a bit dramatic hereâ€”maybe you _like_ opening a dozen apps at a time. We're different people! [Call me out](/contact).)

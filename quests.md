If you let me, I'll lecture you about how it's important to [go on quests](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/quests-are-better-than-pitches) and tell people about them.

This page is where I tell you about _my_ current quests. (See also: [now](/now).)

### Determine and deliver the MED of CRO for SMBs

For years I've done Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) - also known as data-driven website strategy, or "trying to get more people on your website to buy / sign up / whatever". My clients have mostly been enterprise companies or well-funded startups.

These organizations can afford to devote $5-25k per month to making measured improvements to their website as a revenue-generating resource.

But what about online businesses that are just ... smaller? How can I "do CRO" for them in a way that they can afford, and is sustainable for me?

To try and figure this out, I've written a [book](https://yourwebsitesucks.fyi/), and I'm promoting it on [podcasts](/guest-spots).

I've also gotten back on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01f89afda742da31b3) to see if I can meet clients there.

And of course, I created _this_ page so I could tell _you_ about this quest. Do you know any small business owners who rely on their websites to make money? Please consider recommending my book, or just [make an intro](/contact) so we can chat.

### Grow food, and help others grow food

I'm planting and tending fruits and vegetables in our backyard, and I've started an LLC called Goosefoot Nursery. We'll sell seeds and starters for [lost crops](https://sites.wustl.edu/lostcrops/) and exotics.

If you grow food, too, you can help this quest by lending your expertise. If you're willing to chat via [email](/contact) or [voice call](/walk-and-talk), I'm sure I can learn a lot from you and I promise to pass it along.

### Make my local and regional food supply + transportation sector more resilient

I'm exploring a few possible avenues, mostly explained at [eufaula.biz](https://eufaula.biz/) - trying to see if I can help make composting happen, encourage proliferation of community gardens, make it easier to get food direct from farmers and producers.

Also trying to manifest a bike shop and more bike lanes.

If you have experience in any of the above areas, I'd love to learn from you - feel free to [reach out](/contact).

And if you're in Alabama, or the southeast, we should [chat](/contact) about your favorite farmers, ranches, and food producers!

### Be a guy who writes books for a living

A big part of publishing my [first book](https://yourwebsitesucks.fyi/) was to check a box that says "wrote and published a book."

(Even before that, I published a smol [guide to B2B niches](https://gum.co/niche-list) in order to check a box that says "assembled and published a PDF.")

The book has its own mission, but it's part of a broader, longer term project to make writing my primary occupation.

I figure the best way to make this happen is to keep writing and publishing books, getting better at the process *and* developing a clearer picture of the overlap between stuff I want to write about and stuff people will buy books about.

You can help with this project by [buying my book](https://yourwebsitesucks.fyi/), subscribing to my [newsletter](/newsletter), and hitting Reply once in a while to offer feedback or encouragement. Thank you.

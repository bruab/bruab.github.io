It's not you, it's Substack. You're great and I am still reading your newsletter (more on that in a bit). But I'm no longer on any Substack mailing lists for a couple reasons. Specifically: Nazis and dark patterns.

## Nazis

As a writer on Substack, it's worth watching this 2 minute interview with their CEO:

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@decoderpod/video/7221602731998498094" data-video-id="7221602731998498094" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@decoderpod" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@decoderpod?refer=embed">@decoderpod</a> Our host Nilay asked Substack CEO Chris Best the tough questions about whether racist speech should be allowed in their new consumer product, Substack Notes. <a title="techtok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/techtok?refer=embed">#techtok</a> <a title="technews" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/technews?refer=embed">#technews</a> <a title="substack" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/substack?refer=embed">#substack</a> <a title="ceo" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ceo?refer=embed">#ceo</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Decoder with Nilay Patel" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7221602698636905258?refer=embed">♬ original sound - Decoder with Nilay Patel</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>

Why did he have such a hard time with the question? Because he is not willing to miss out on the revenue that comes from monetizing Nazi newsletters. Like [this one](https://whitepapersinstitute.substack.com/about), dedicated to promoting "the collective interests of Whites who seek self-determination for their nations and freedom from foreign influence."

You're obviously not a Nazi! But you're hanging out in the [Nazi bar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar), and I don't care to join you there.

## Dark patterns

As a _reader_ of Substack, the experience is replete with manipulative hacks. Like:

- Asking me to subscribe to a publication as soon as I visit it, without letting me browse first
- Taking me to an ambiguous "Choose a plan" page after I subscribe, which leaves me unclear on whether I've already subscribed or must choose a plan to complete the process
- Hitting me with "Subscribe" popups throughout each article and email 
- Showing a one-step "Subscribe to these too!" popup when I'm just trying to get back to the article I was reading, encouraging me to sign up for stuff I don't want to read
- Waylaying me with a "Download the app!" popup that's designed to look like downloading the app is necessary to continue reading

In UX-land we call these [dark patterns](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/deceptive-patterns/) and they are a thing you do to maximize value to the business at the expense of users.

That's not your vibe, and I don't want to associate that kind of experience with you. So I don't subscribe to your newsletter, and I don't read it on Substack's website.

## I'm still reading your stuff

I've installed an RSS feed reader called [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) and added your newsletter feed to my list. I will log in from time to time and see what you've been writing, and send you an email to let you know how much I enjoy it. 

I hope this works for you! Wishing you all the luck in the world with your writing career. I just can't stand the ambiance in the place you've chosen to house it.

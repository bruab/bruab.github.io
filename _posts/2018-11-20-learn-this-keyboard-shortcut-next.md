I was on a call using Google Meet with someone who was new to the platform. As he worked to find his way around the interface, I mentioned "You can use ‚åò-E to toggle your camera, and ‚åò-D to mute/unmute." And he said "Yeah, or with the mental energy it would take to learn that, I could just click."

Of course he's right. You can't go stuffing random keyboard shortcuts into your brain in hopes of instant productivity gains, increased flow, and immediate hacker ninja street cred. You need a system. Here it is.

### How to use this post

Scroll until you find the _first_ shortcut that you're not already using on a regular basis. Read the entry, practice it right now a couple times, and resolve to keep using it for the next week. (If you find yourself reverting to the mouse and menu for this action, gently remind yourself that you're an efficient person and you use shortcuts to perform common actions. Then use the shortcut.)

Once the shortcut has become a habit, come back and scroll down to the _next_ shortcut you're not already using on a regular basis. One at a time. No rush. The next one will be here for you when you're ready.

Here are the shortcuts, in the order you should learn them:

### ‚åò-C and ‚åò-V to Copy and Paste

You may never click on the **Edit** menu again. Use these commands to copy and paste not just text, but images, links, spreadsheet rows and formulas ... just about anything you can select with a mouse.

**Where it works:**

- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer)
- Docs / Word
- Spreadsheets
- Email
- Much much more

### ‚åò-Z to Undo

This one is a huge confidence booster. Who cares if you make mistakes when you can undo them faster than you can blink? ‚åò-Z works in more applications than you might think. You can even try it in conversation üôä.

**Where it works:**

- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer)
- Docs / Word
- Spreadsheets
- Email
- Google Calendar
- Much much more

### ‚åò-X to Cut

This is ‚åò-C's _slightly_ less useful cousin. Most of us copy text more often than we cut, but if you're moving paragraphs in a document or blocks in a spreadsheet, you'll get plenty of mileage out of ‚åò-X / ‚åò-V.

**Where it works:**

- Input fields on websites
- Docs / Word
- Spreadsheets
- Email
- Much much more

### ‚åò-A to Select All

Once you're comfy with ‚åò-C, ‚åò-X, and ‚åò-V, you're likely moving text and images around at will, like some sort of powerful cubicle wizard. But how do you select the items you're copying and pasting? In cases where it's "the entire input field" or "the entire comment" or "the entire email" ... you get the idea ... ‚åò-A + ‚åò-C is a super quick way to select and copy. Then ‚åò-V wherever suits your wizardly fancy.

**Where it works:**

- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer)
- Docs / Word
- Spreadsheets
- Email
- Much much more

### ‚åò-F to Find (or Search)

Buried in the **Edit** menu, the 'Find' feature might be one that you'd use a lot more if it was easier to get to. Here's your shortcut. Trying to figure out whether a web page has the content you're looking for? Need to get to a specific entry in a spreadsheet? Want to go back and screenshot a coworker's egregious Slack comment from last week? Find.

**Where it works:**

- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer)
- Docs / Word
- Spreadsheets
- Email
- Slack
- Much much more

### ‚åò-T to Open a New Tab

If you've made it this far, congratulations. You're finding and manipulating text, images, and links completely click-free. This shortcut isn't nearly as universal as the preceding ones, but if you spend a lot of time using a web browser, you'll save a ton of time with it.

**Where it works:**

- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer)
- Terminal

### ‚åò-W to Close a Tab

Now that you're opening new tabs without clicking, start closing them the same way. Never again will your wrist and eyeballs strain to find that little 'X'.

**Where it works:**

- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer)
- Terminal

### ‚åò-S to Save

This one works all over the place, including in most specialized native apps. If you're a regular user of Sketch, iMovie, GarageBand, or VLC, no more clicking 'File' to save. ‚åò-S and keep going.

**Where it works:**

- Word
- Spreadsheets
- iMovie
- GarageBand
- Quicktime
- Alfred
- Sketch
- Much much more

### ‚åò-Return to Send

Typing messages, comments, emails, etc. is an inconsistent experience across sites and platforms. While not 100% universal, this combo is a very common way to say "Send". Not "line break" or "expand an emoji" or all the other things that Return might do - just send it already. As a rule of thumb (and pinky), if you see a 'Send' button, try ‚åò-Return before you click.

**Where it works:**

- Input fields on (some) websites
- Comments in Google Docs
- Gmail
- Slack
- Much much more

### ‚åò-Shift-{ and ‚åò-Shift-} to Switch Browser Tabs

Okay, now we're getting pretty esoteric. But if you've learned to open and close tabs without mousing, you might as well be able to move between them as well. This is a three-finger combo (skill level: advanced) but once you teach your pinkies where to go, you'll likely get a ton of use out of it. And if you're a "hundred open tabs" type of person, you'll no longer have to squint to find and click that three-millimeter-wide tab next to the current one :)

**Where it works:**

- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer)
- Terminal

### ‚åò-L to Select Browser Address Bar

This shortcut is distant cousin to ‚åò-T and ‚åò-W. It simply shifts focus to the address bar in your browser. Use it when you want to navigate somewhere but you _don't_ want to open a new tab. Just ‚åò-L and start typing.

**Where it works:**

- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer)

### ‚åò-Shift-V to Paste Without Formatting

If you copy formatted text, then paste it and get a hot mess, this is your shortcut. Undo your last paste with ‚åò-Z, then use ‚åò-Shift-V to paste the text only, leaving behind the formatting.

**Where it works:**

- Docs / Word
- Spreadsheets
- Gmail
- Much much more

If you're a regular user of all the above ‚òùÔ∏è shortcuts, congratulations. At this point you probably seek out and learn app-specific shortcuts on your own. What are your favorites? <a href="/contact">Get in touch</a>; you can probably teach me a thing or two.

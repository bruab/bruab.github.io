Say we've got a B2B lead generation website. Most visitors land on our richly informative homepage. There are also About, How it Works, Case Studies, and Contact Us pages.

Visitors can visit Contact Us from anywhere on the site, so our quote-unquote funnel looks like:

**(Any page) --> Contact Us --> ðŸ’¥**

The Contact Us page essentially _is_ the funnel. So getting more traffic to it will surely translate to moar conversions ðŸ’°.

After careful deliberation, we launch an experiment that makes the following changes:

- Remove all CTAs that do not point to Contact Us (excluding site navigation)
- Add 3-5 extra Contact Us CTAs to each page
- Launch an interstitial window on exit intent that says "Wait! Contact Us!"

2 weeks have gone by and we see a marked increase in form page visits. In fact, we're seeing a _43% increase_ in the Homepage --> Contact Us conversion rate.

So, did we improve the site?

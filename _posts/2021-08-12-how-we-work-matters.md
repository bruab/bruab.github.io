These things:

- How, and how often we communicate
- When we start and stop working, and when we take breaks
- The tools we use
- When and how often we meet, and for what purposes

... have a significant impact on these things:

- How effective we are
- Our health
- Our satisfaction with work, and with life

I could probably trot out some pseudoscientific studies to bolster this claim but I'm just leaving here as a strongly held belief. Happy to [talk about it](https://briandavidhall.com/connect/) if you ever want to!

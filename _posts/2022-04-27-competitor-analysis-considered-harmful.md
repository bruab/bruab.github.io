It's a good idea to be aware of what your competitors are up to, but you must be extremely careful.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, you should assume that their strategy is misguided, ineffective, and doomed to fail spectacularly.

This is to protect you from the temptation - driven by fear - to copy whatever they're up to.

Giving in to this temptation can only lead to mediocrity and homogeneity.

When you assess your competition, do it from your _customer's_ perspective. 

Your goal is not to learn what the other team is doing so you can emulate it. Your goal is to learn what the other team is doing, so you better understand the _experience of a potential customer who is comparison shopping._

And the one thing a comparison shopper will appreciate ... is finding something authentic and unique.

I've created and edited hundreds of videos over the course of the last few years. I've used Descript, Screenflow, Final Cut Pro, and various in-app editors. I've shared these videos on my now-nearly-defunct YouTube channel, on my now-defunct TikTok account, for clients and [courses](/courses). I even hosted a now-defunct video creators' community, and explored running a video editing agency. (We served a couple clients, weren't optimistic about the uniqueness or margins of the business model ... it's now defunct :)

No more.

From here on out, I'm not editing any more videos. It turns out I'm the worst kind of person on earth for this kind of work.

## Why?

I'm the kind of nerd who enjoys pursuing mastery of tools. Any tool. So I get really into learning features and shortcuts for whatever tool I'm using.

This isn't a bad thing, but I also have a nasty perfectionist streak.

You might not know that from watching any of the videos I shared! But each time I hit "Upload" it was a forceful decision to quit overthinking, quit tweaking, move on with life. Each time I stopped editing (I never really _finished_) it cost me.

On top of that, some of the videos I made were collaborative. Interviews that I thoroughly enjoyed, then proceeded to turn into nightmare projects of obsessive fussing.

Add a hefty dose of people-pleasing to the perfectionism, put someone else's image and expectations on the line, and you have a recipe for a never-finished, never-published video. I've got three of these in my queue right now. I'm abandoning them. It feels terrible. But at least I'm not adding to the queue.

## What I'll do instead

As evidenced by the inclusion of a one-take, no-edits video at the top of this post ... I'll do one-take videos and share them without editing.

I'll focus on training myself to recover when I misspeak, or fumble my words, or stutter. I'll push myself to let a video be Good Enough as it is. Hopefully this will train me to be a better [podcast guest](/guest-spots) so by mid-2024, when I hope to start marketing my second book, I can enter those calls with confidenceâ€”and leave the edits to the hosts.

I'll turn my nerdy passion for tools to focus on using [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) to add a bit of flourish to my live recordings.

I'll spend more time on prep for videos, but not much moreâ€”nothing even close to how long I used to spend on edits.

I'm on the fence as to whether I trust myself to edit _audio_ content. I had a blast recording a proof-of-concept podcast episode for my blog post about [criticism of Jimi Hendrix](https://onestar.world/jimi-hendrix/), and I'd like to do more. Audio is way simpler than video.

So, do I dare trust myself with a few Audacity sessions? Probably, we'll see. (Watch this space for a January 2025 "I'm not allowed to edit mp3s" post.)

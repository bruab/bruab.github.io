Tonight is a full moon. (Also the [buck moon](https://www.almanac.com/content/full-moon-july), also a [supermoon](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/03/1185769181/supermoon-buck-moon-night-sky-monday).)

Starting tomorrow, and continuing until the new moon on July 17th, I will complete one project every day, and share my progress as I go.

## Why do this?

So many reasons!

For starters, I've got a bunch of semi-completed projects that have been languishing for weeks. Maybe you can relate. Putting some pressure on myself to close these open loops is a Good Thing, and public accountability has worked for me before.

I've also got several _new_ projects I'm eager to work on, but I want to make sure I don't just bury myself further in drafts and incomplete checklists.

There's more. I use ConvertKit to send emails, and since I'm [no longer on social media](/social) it seems like getting good at that tool is a wise investment. Setting up the infrastructure to send 14 daily emails to a small subsegment of my list is a learning exercise that'll help me start down the path to email wizardry.

Not only that, but doing this experiment gives me a chance to explore working on "non-calendar time"—something I'm curious about in its own right. Does tying my work to the actual rhythms of nature (rather than an [arbitrary formula](https://www.almanac.com/content/why-week-has-seven-days)) _feel_ different? Do I get more—or less—done? One way to find out.

## What it looks like

I'll send out a daily email with an update on what I finished. It'll be things like new [book](https://onestar.world/) chapters, audio recordings of chapters from my [first book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7), podcast episodes, maybe lessons in a new email course.

## Join me! If you want. No pressure

[Sign up here](https://skilled-mover-4977.ck.page/82702eb3da) to get the 14 daily emails.

You can follow along quietly, or cheer me on if you'd like.

Or do your own moonsprint: Resolve to complete any number of projects (could be one, definitely doesn't have to be 14 :) between now and the new moon. Tell me about it and we'll keep each other accountable.

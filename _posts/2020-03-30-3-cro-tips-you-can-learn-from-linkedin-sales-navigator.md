One way to find inspiration for your own website is to keep an eye out for highly optimized conversion experiences in the wild.

I recently came across an excellent example: the LinkedIn Sales Navigator signup page.

Here are three things this page gets right, and how you can apply them to your own site to increase conversions.

### Context: Remind visitors why they're here

Right at the top of the page, LinkedIn _reminds_ me of a few facts that should be blindingly obvious:

- I'm on the checkout page
- I've selected Sales Navigator Professional
- The purpose of this tool is to "unlock more sales opportunities"

Yeah, duh ðŸ¤¤. I only managed to reach this page by selecting the Professional product, and clicking a Checkout button.

But it's never safe to assume that visitors are paying such close attention. People have 3, 5, or 50 other tabs open. Their phones buzz, their boss asks questions, Slack pings come in ... it's easy to lose your place on the interwebs.

Having a clear, concise signpost like this one ensures that visitors remember where they are and what they're here to do.

### Focus: Remove distractions

This page is _super clean_ compared to the actual LinkedIn interface.

The navigation is minimal, with just a couple of icons. There's no sidebar, no images.

With the exception of the LinkedIn icon at the top, the links on the page open in a new tab. Once you reach this page, you can convert, you can close the tab, or you can return to the homepage - but that's it.

(Compare these limited options with the overwhelming variety of clicks available on the regular site ... or on _your_ site.)

### Reassurance: Address last minute objections

In addition to those open-in-a-new-tab links to the refund and cancellation policies, the page adds a few FAQs at the bottom:

(I wouldn't be surprised if the LinkedIn team had run A/B tests to determine whether this content helps or hurts conversions, as well as which questions belong here.)

Note that these are minor operational concerns that might cause hesitation at the last moment, each with a concise, positive answer.

The conversion page is _not_ the place to sell the product! This information is here to address last minute doubts, not questions about the product's value or purpose.

The page also uses the phrase "Secure Checkout" in two locations - at the top and below the CTA. What does "secure" even mean? Doesn't much matter, it's a reassuring word.

### What you can do today

Take a look at your own site. What is the page, or view, that visitors see right before they convert?

Check for these three elements:

- **Context.** Does the page remind them what they're getting, and why?
- **Focus.** Does the page eliminate unnecessary elements and links?
- **Reassurance.** Do you promise to keep their information safe? Do you anticipate, and address, last minute concerns?

These three concepts are at play for SaaS signup pages like LinkedIn Sales Navigator, but are equally relevant for lead generation forms or Ecommerce checkout pages.

So go add a signpost, remove some clutter, and anticipate hesitation. Then sit back and smugly watch your conversions ðŸ“ˆ.

Speaking from my own experience:

**Ergonomics matter.** Surprise, 6 hours spent hunched over, or squinting, or with your arms unnaturally extended ... will leave you feeling tired and sore. A chair and desk and monitor that fit your body are worth it if you can possibly afford them.

**When you work on what ... matters.** There's a whole [book](https://www.danpink.com/books/when/) on this topic (it's [probably pseudoscience](https://briandavidhall.com/we-dont-know-shit/)), but anecdotally I work _way_ more effectively in the morning when doing creative or challenging, focused work. Afternoons are good for socializing or reading but I am not gonna be smart, sorry.

**Tools matter.** Flow is a thing, and it's easier to achieve and maintain when the feedback loop between you and your tools is a tight one. Waiting 8 seconds for a new Google Analytics view to load ... breaks you out of flow. Closing a browser tab with âŒ˜-W instead of using a mouse ... keeps you in flow. Investing in good tools and learning to use them means Future You will be capable of amazing things.

**Channels and policies matter.** By default, Slack becomes an always-on, instant-response-expected flow-killer. Explicitly stating expectations about availability and reply time helps a ton. Choosing to use asynchronous video instead of Zoom leads to different levels of joy and effectiveness for everyone involved.

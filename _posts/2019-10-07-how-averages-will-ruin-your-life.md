Check this out: immediately after college, graduates with STEM degrees earn an average of $10,000 more than graduates with humanities degrees.

But by age 40, those with humanities degrees earn slightly _more_ than those who studied STEM.

On average.

You might find this data comforting if you're really into Greek Literature or archaeology. Sure, you'll start off earning a bit less, but in the long run it'll work out. Right?

Not exactly. The _average_ 40-year-old humanities degree holder income is skewed by a relatively small number of ultra-high-earning careers - lawyers, successful politicians, CEOs.

If your plan is to get that archaeology degree and go into law school ... yeah, you'll probably be fine. If that's definitely _not_ your path, you'll likely find yourself earning _less_ than that average by age 40. Sorry.

**WTF does that have to do with CRO tho**

Anytime someone hands you an average, you should look at it funny. Like it might be hiding a tragic lie. Unless you know about the _distribution_ of the underlying data set, you're in a place of ignorance.

Your average time on site is 1:28. Great! Does that mean you've got a minute and a half with every single visitor? _Let's see ... ü§î 15 seconds to marvel at your beautiful hero image, 45 seconds to fill out your contact form, and 30 seconds to browse content after converting üèÜ._

No way. What you've got is a ton of visitors who stick around for a matter of seconds, a handful who stick around for a while, and a select few who spend all their waking hours on your site. The average is meaningless.

On the other hand, if you can get _fewer_ "matter of seconds" visitors while getting _more_ "stick around for a while" visitors (and ignoring the "all their waking hours" folks), that's a win. Whether the average changes or not.

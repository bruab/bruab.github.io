It's [hard to know your own strengths](https://twitter.com/Katharine_Mckee/status/1372914467877621770?s=20).

It's safe to assume there are significant truths about your strengths (and weaknesses) that you just don't have access to.

_And_ it's important to know what you're good at, so you can [save the world](https://briandavidhall.com/save-the-world-shit/). (Or make more money I guess.)

So, I'm working on it. Here's a running list of things I believe I'm good at, and things other people have said I'm good at.

### IMO I'm good at:

- Teaching & tutoring
- Writing
- Digital analytics & strategy
- Mentoring developers
- Cheerleading
- Dog training

### Others have said my strengths are:

- Compassion
- Storytelling
- Communication

If you disagree with anything on this list, or you can add to it, [plz tell me](https://briandavidhall.com/connect/). Give the gift of unknown unknowns ðŸ¤—

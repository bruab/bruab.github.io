Let's look at some pathological optimization patterns.

Say you've got a B2B lead generation website. Most visitors land on your richly informative homepage. From there, some go deeper and learn about your offering. A handful go on to visit the Contact Us page and fill out a form.

Obviously you'd like to see that last step happen more often. If you could get homepage visitors more _engaged_ you'd surely see leads go up.

So you study your primary CTA - the dreaded [Learn More](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/learn-more-links/) button, pointing to your How it Works page.

More people clicking on that CTA means more people engaged with the site, a lower bounce rate, and more leads. Surely.

You want to make a BIG impact, so you change the CTA to say "Click Here for $1,000 Cash."

Over the weeks that follow, you see a huge spike in engagement. Bounce rates are down. Pages per session are up.

Your homepage heat map shows the CTA lit up like a volcano ðŸŒ‹. You print it and hang it on the wall.

Did you actually improve the site?

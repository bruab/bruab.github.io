description: I built a mobile-friendly website for this small farm, integrated mailing list and e-commerce solutions, and clarified their social media strategy. These hardworking clients are now able to sell their produce across multiple media while they're sleeping. Or planting. Or harvesting. Or whatever else you do on a farm that's more important than fiddling with PayPal :)

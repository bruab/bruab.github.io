You know how Facebook tracks your every scroll, click, and view in order to build a profile of your habits and tastes, so they can sell access to your eyeballs based on that profile?

It's probably not your favorite thing that they do. But if you use Facebook anyway, it's because you've decided the tradeoff is acceptable. Maybe it's the only platform where you're able to keep in touch with certain classmates or family members. Maybe you get amazing deals on the marketplace.

Still, if there was another version of Facebookâ€”or several other versionsâ€”that had all the same features, content, and people, but _didn't_ track your behavior ... you'd probably use that instead. Right?

By the end of 2024, Google's Chrome web browser will be tracking every page you visit and engage with in order to build a profile of your interests. (You can see a provisional list of those interests [here](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/blob/main/taxonomy_v2.md).)

This is all part of their work-in-progress but already-creepy [Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/) initiative, which is less about "prioritizing privacy" and more about "avoiding prosecution for privacy violations by as narrow a margin as possible."

The _amazing_ news here is that unlike Facebook, Google Chrome is 100% replaceable. Just pick another browser. Any browser. _None_ of them will attempt anything remotely close to this type of tracking.

Personally, I've switched to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and it works great. Give it a shot, or try another one. Like Safari, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, or [Lynx](https://lynx.browser.org/):

It doesn't really matter what you pick. Just don't use Chrome.

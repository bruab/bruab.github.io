We don't fully understand why we make decisions. In fact, [decisions are made in our brains before we become aware of having decided](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5443390_Unconscious_determinants_of_free_decisions_in_the_human_brain).

So when we outline a logical explanation for our decision, we're making it up after the fact.

It's not necessarily all false or wrong, though it might be. But it's definitely incomplete, and it might _entirely leave out_ the predominant factor in our decision.

When we explain our reasoning, we're telling a story to ourselves and others. Stories are great! We can learn from them. But we know they're not true.

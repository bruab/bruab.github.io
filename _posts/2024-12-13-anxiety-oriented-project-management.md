In the past I've advocated for [vibes-based project management](/vibes-based-project-management), which is great when everything feels light and the world is full of possibility. But sometimes things feel heavy and the world feels full of judgement and impending failure.

In these situations, try the following.

## List out all your projects

_Don't_ open up a todo app or project management tool and for fuck's sake do not ask a chatbot. Use a piece of paper or blank text file. If you can't remember a project, it's not important right now.

## Ask: "Which one induces the most anxiety?"

It will probably jump out at you. Of course, just seeing them all listed in one place is its own source of generalized anxiety, but really try to focus on how you feel in your body (especially your head, chest, and stomach) as you look over _each item in the list_. 

You must pick one. (If this is really hard, because there are two or three that feel equally terrible, pick one of them at random.)

## Ask: "What would I have to get done to feel better about this?"

Lean in to the bad feeling and try to carry yourself forward into the future. Imagine a moment where for _this one project_, things are actually under control and the anxiety dissipates. What has to happen?

It might be a lot of work! That's okay. But once you have an answer, consider whether you can get away with a little bit less. Do you have to finish the slide deck, or would outlining it be enough to change how you're feeling? Do you have to send the newsletter, or is it enough to write a draft and then go for a walk?

## Work on absolutely nothing else until you reach that milestone

If you've truly chosen the most anxiety-inducing project to work on, this should feel simultaneously terrifying and comforting. Focus on the fact that you're no longer hiding from your problems. Remind yourself that ignoring your other tasks is actually a healthy, mature, conscious decision that's in your own best interest. 

Then do whatever you need to do—close some tabs, put on headphones, set a timer—and get to work. Then repeat.

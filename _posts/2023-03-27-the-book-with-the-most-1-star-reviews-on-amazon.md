... is unknown. (If you're an Amazon employee and you'd like to leak this information, you can [get in touch](/contact).)

Here's what we do know: among the _best-selling_ books on the site*, the one with the most 1-star reviews is [Fifty Shades of Grey](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/0345803485/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar). It has 13,651 1-star ratings (out of 111,090).

Here are the 1-star review counts for other best sellers, as of Monday, March 27, 2023:

- [To Kill a Mockingbird](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/0446310786/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar): 2,251 (out of 106,548 ratings)
- [The Hunger Games](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/0439023483/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar): 1,285 (out of 76,131 ratings)
- [Harry Potter Paperback Box Set](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/0545162076/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar): 1,419 (out of 101,754 ratings)

You might notice that these are all works of fiction. What about nonfiction books with lots of 1-star reviews? A couple of the top sellers are:

- [Strengths Finder 2.0](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001CDZZI6/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar): 814 (out of 8,106 ratings)
- [How to Win Friends & Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/0671027034/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar): 1,921 (out of 104,412 ratings)

Looks like Dale Carnegie may be the author to beat within the realm of nonfiction.

If you come across a book with more 1-star review than _50 Shades of Grey_, or a _nonfiction_ book with more single-stars than _How to Win Friends etc._, please [let me know](/contact). I'm working on a thing ...

Interesting. Why?

**To coincide with an upcoming event or promotion.**

I hear you; there's only one chance to get the test live in time for the promo.

If it isn't ready in time, we can't launch it at all - and we spent all that time and effort on it ([#sunkcostfallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)).

And it shouldn't have taken this long anyway ([#planningfallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy)).

Is it possible to run a successful promotion without the test? Probably. But is it possible to run a successful promotion if we launch a broken test?

**We haven't hit our target number of test launches this month.**

"Number of tests" is a [terrible success metric](https://briandavidhall.com/why-number-of-tests-is-a-terrible-success-metric/). Assuming we're stuck with it, though, can we scrap this experiment and do something with button colors instead? ðŸ˜‰

**We wanted to launch it last week, and it's still not live.**

So frustrating. But for all the same reasons we [don't launch on Fridays](https://briandavidhall.com/dont-launch-on-friday/), we shouldn't launch in a rush. We're frustrated now, but think of how we'll feel if we ship a broken experiment.

**We do everything in a frickin' hurry.**

Thanks for your candor. You shouldn't be testing. And I have somewhere to be ...

The year is 1138.

You’re a renowned midwife who attended the world’s first medical school, and became the world’s first gynecologist.

You look like this (sorry):

![image of trota of salerno](/images/trota-of-salerno.jpg){:style="max-width:400px;"}

You’ve also written a handy little volume of cures and remedies, and given it the jaunty title _De curis mulierum_ ("On Treatments for Women").

What expectations might you have for your one-of-a-kind work?

As a professor at the Medical School of Salerno, you might hope that future classes would study it, implement its findings, and in time add to the body of knowledge it represents.

That’s _kind of_ what happened to [Trota of Salerno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trota_of_Salerno).

_De curis mulierum_ was preserved, and several decades later scholars combined it with two other works on women’s health. That’s where it gets weird.

Trota was credited as author of _all three works_, even though she only wrote one. They called the compendium _Trotula_ \- “the little work of Trota.”

_Fame and recognition beyond expectation!_

Except … as time went on, confusion set in. Readers came to believe that “Trotula” was the name of the author.

Centuries later, in 1566, an editor decided to remove all mention of Trota or Trotula from the text, and attribute it to some made up guy named Eros instead. And pretend it was written in ancient Rome instead of the middle ages. Because why not.

_Erasure!_

Centuries after _that_, in 1985, another scholar unraveled the mystery of the _Trotula_ \- three authors, one of whom was a woman. Named Trota.

He also discovered _another_ of her works. And now you are reading about her.

_Redemption!_

The fate of your work is outside your control, unpredictable.

If you’re hesitating to share something with the world, I’ll suggest you imagine that some scholar in the year 2639 attributes your work to a made up guy named Orville.

That sucks, but are you glad at least people are still interested in what you have to say? Better share it, then.

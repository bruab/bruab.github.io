Seems like thick-skinned-ness is unevenly distributed among humans. The fact that you're reading this likely means that you're vulnerable to taking criticism personally*.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are artists who seem impervious to disapproval, no matter how vicious.

And among these artists, Jan Terri is the queen.

She recorded music throughout the 90s. It's unlikely you were following her career back then. But it's _possible_ you've heard of her, because in 2006 someone uploaded one of her videos to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2l6CPna4M), titled it "The worst music video ever," and it proceeded to get millions** of views.

It's easy (and kind of fun) to watch this video and mock its production quality, or Terri's voice, or ... lots of things.

It's much harder to watch it and imagine being the person who made it, and knowing that millions of people are laughing at you.

So how did Jan Terri respond to being accused of making the worst video ever?

> That’s just somebody’s opinion ... A lot of people who are depressed or who got bullied tell me that my music makes them feel better, so that’s a good sign. At least it’s helping somebody. ([link](https://www.laweekly.com/losing-you-internet-sensation-jan-terri-is-laying-low-in-lake-elsinore/))

I cannot in good faith tell you "Just be like Jan." I'd love to be like Jan, but it's easier said than done.

Still, the next time you find yourself hesitating to share something for fear of criticism, outrage, or mockery, remember: Someone out there has been through way worse than you're likely to face. And she's fine. You'll be fine too.

*That's not a criticism! For what it's worth, I take things personally all the time. It's why [I never check unsubscribes](/newsletter).

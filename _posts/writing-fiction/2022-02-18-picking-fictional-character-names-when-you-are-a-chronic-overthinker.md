title: "Picking fictional character names when you are a chronic overthinker"

I've been writing a story over in [Snowflake Fiction Pomodoros](https://lu.ma/fiction-pomodoros){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and after working with placeholder names for a while I decided it was time to commit. No more dialogue like

"... and when was the last time you talked to `$SupportingCharacter?`"

Except ... I hated every name I picked. They all sounded so ... fictional.

Fortunately I found a way to take the mental labor out of this task and make it fun. You will love it.

Just visit this link: https://tiffzhang.com/startup/

Each time you click it, you'll get a different, absurd, randomly-generated startup landing page.

Each page contains an "Our Team" section with names and profile photos.

Just browse random made-up startups until you see a name that works for your nameless character.

It's quick, fun, and will save you from second guessing yourself.

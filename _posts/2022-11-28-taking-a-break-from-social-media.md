I quit Facebook several years ago. It felt great, and I still have no regrets.

A few years later, I quit Instagram. Felt great, no regrets.

About a year ago, I decided to try out TikTok. I made over 100 videos.

I had some fun, learned a lot, but ultimately decided to quit. It felt great, etc.

Over the course of the TikTok experiment, I started a new Instagram account and started cross-posting my videos there as well. But even though it only took up about 20 minutes of my time _per week_, I just didn't enjoy using the platform. So I quit. Guess how it felt?

I've been on LinkedIn for over a decade, and I've hated _just about every minute of it._ I wonder how I'd feel if I quit?

Twitter is my favorite platform by far, and I've made lots of interesting friends there. But it's now a private company, which my participation helps to grow. I wonder how I'd feel if I quit?

One way to find out.

As of Monday, November 28, 2022, I'm stopping all activity across all social media platforms, making my accounts private, and focusing on one-to-one conversations via phone and email.

I'll update this post with a reflection after a month or so.

In the meantime, I'd love to have a one-to-one conversation with _you_ about whether [social media makes you miserable](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/don-t-let-social-media-make-you-miserable) or not. What platforms do you use, and why? Have you tried taking breaks? How did it go?

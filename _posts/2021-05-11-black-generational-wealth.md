I think a lot about [metrics](https://briandavidhall.com/tag/metrics/), [KPIs](https://briandavidhall.com/tag/kpis/), what to measure and optimize for. At the societal level, Black generational wealth is a insightful metric, and increasing it is a worthy goal.

If you're unsure of what the phrase refers to, or if it makes you uncomfortable, please take 4 minutes to watch this video, shared by ICE-T:

Based on my own [priorities](https://briandavidhall.com/causes/), impacting this metric is a major goal of mine, though I'm just starting to figure out how to go about it. Here's what I got so far:

- I support & will vote for taxes on wealth and inheritance
- I support & will vote for reparations
- I provide training, research, and guides to support freelancers\*
- I connect Black professionals with job and contract opportunities

\*My assumption is that being self-employed is a better way to build wealth, and that the power to choose your clients gives you a better firewall against racism than being an employee at a traditional company. If you think that's wrong omg [plz let's talk](https://briandavidhall.com/connect/) üôè

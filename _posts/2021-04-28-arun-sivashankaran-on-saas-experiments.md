#### Quotes

- "Quantity goes down, but quality goes up, and if you're only measuring the number of form fills and lead captures, you're gonna miss that."
- "Just because a tool will let you measure something on-site, that doesn't mean it's sufficient."
- "If you commit yourself to actually measuring what matters ... that's gonna change the nature of experiments that you're gonna run."
- "There's no magical binary thing that happens from 94 to 95 percent significance."
- "If you're optimizing Zappos.com, what you're going to do is make it easier to buy shoes ... in a Demand Gen site, it's different. You have different types of intent."
- "The major source of friction is how well the site communicates an offer to me that's relevant to my interests."

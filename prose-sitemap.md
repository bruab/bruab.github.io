My site has a lot of pages. This is a mostly complete guide to all of them, in narrative form. (Blog posts are [here](/blog).)

In January 2023 I attended an Offers and Needs market. I think if we all communicated better about what we need, and what we can offer, the world would be a much better place. So I created an [offers](/offers) page and a [needs](/needs) page. 

I update them weekly-ish, along with my [now](/now) page, and my list of [current quests](/quests).

Similar to the 'offers' page but more targeted is this [pro bono services](/pro-bono) page.

One set of pages I won't link to here is the customized "thank you" pages I make for when people do nice stuff like sign up for my [weekly work in progress newsletter](/newsletter) or my monthly-ish [making sense of the weird present newsletter](/blip). (To see the thank-you pages, you'll have to sign up!) 

I wrote a book, and I'm chronicling my efforts to get people to buy it on [this page](/marketing-your-website-sucks-book). The book's on Amazon, but I'm curious about the option to sell the next one elsewhere, so I started a [list of authors who don't sell on Amazon](/authors-who-dont-use-amazon).

I wrote another book before that one. Full list of books [here](/books).

One book marketing tactic I'm experimenting with is guest blogging. For each publication I work with, I create a landing page. Here's [one example](/cpa).

A future book will be about outreach, and [this page](/long-game-outreach) is its future home. I'm also collecting [outreach scripts](/outreach-scripts).

I'd like to rely on word of mouth marketing for my books and services, so I'm collecting notes on that topic [here](/word-of-mouth-marketing). Also when you're self publishing, you have to list an imprint in order to buy ISBNs for your book. I called mine [Ecru Press](/ecru-press) after my dumb dog, and gave it a page to make it official.

I host a weekly coworking session, which of course has its own [page](/social-pomodoros). 

(I used to host more events, and I had a separate '[clubs](/clubs)' page. Then I decided that sounded too elitist, so I renamed it to '[meetups](/meetups)'. But now if you click either of those links they just redirect to the first link in this paragraph.)

Some pages, like the "authors who don't use Amazon" one, are just lists I keep for reference. There are several of these. Like a [list of disastrous website redesigns](/disastrous-redesigns), a list of [groundbreaking commercial innovations](/innovation), a list of [good businesses](/good-businesses), a list of [rejected technologies](/rejected-tech), a list of [tools I use](/stack), a list of [my affiliate links](/affiliate-links), and a list of [places you can find me on the internet](/cozyweb-directory).

There's also a list of [topics I like to talk about](/topics). And a (partial) list of [times I've fucked up](/fuckups).

Some of the pages on my site are extremely fancy pages that run code. Like my [niche generator](/niche-generator) page, or a page I built that gives you a [random icebreaker](/icebreakers). (These are among the entries on my page of [generators](/generators).)

I've got a page for all the stuff I offer for [free](/free) - mostly [courses](/courses). (There's also a free [guide to session recordings](/session-recordings), and a [free audit](/free-audit) offer.)

Then there are sales pages for services I provide. Like my [Google Analytics 4](/ga4) page, or my [digital gardening as a service](/dgaas) page. What else? [Coaching](/coaching). [Website audits](/audit). I've also got a [support](/support) page.

You can read my [sales page template](/sales-page-template), too. And see a list of [audits](/audits).

Speaking of work, I have a [work](/work) page, an [education](/education) page, and a page that lists [every job I've ever had](/all-jobs). And a page of all the [websites](/websites) I manage. And some website [swipe files](/swipe-files).

(If you're clicking on the work links, maybe you're trying to decide if I'm competent and trustworthy. I made a page of [testimonials](/kind-words) that hopefully helps build that case.)

I don't always sell servicesâ€”sometimes I just introduce potential clients to smart and helpful people. There's a partial list of those smart and helpful people [here](/rolodex).

I've got a page that lists [guest appearances](/guest-spots) I've made on other folks' podcasts and YouTube channels, and I usually make a dedicated page to share with their audience (e.g. my [FreelanceU page](/freelanceu) or my [Deliberate Freelancer](/deliberate-freelancer) page).

Speaking of guest appearances, I also have a [media](/media) page.

I quit social media and made a [page about that](/social). Then I missed posting, so I made a page for [takes](/takes).

Some other pages that were born in the aftermath of leaving social media: a "let's be friends" link to share with fellow [conversion optimization folks](/cro-friends), a signup page for my [paper-and-snail-mail newsletter](/letters).

Want to send me a message? Visit my [contact](/contact) page. (Want to send it encrypted? Here's my [public key](/public-key).)

There's some personal stuff here, like a page about my [pets](/pets). Some [fiction](/fiction) I've written. A collection of [quotes](/quotes) I like and [visions for the future](/visions). [Weird art](/weird-art) that inspires me, and [work that inspires me](/inspiration).

I typed all these words myself, and even have a page about [that](/human).

That's it! Thanks for reading.

The highest form of marketing is: Stunts.

By which I mean, doing something worth talking about. It doesn't have to be as newsworthy as [driving a tank through Times Square](https://www.inc.com/oscar-raymundo/richard-branson-most-explosive-publicity-stunt.html) or [getting a town to name itself after your URL](https://www.wired.com/1999/12/welcome-to-half-com-oregon/).

Lots of stunts _do_ take the form of "elaborate and kind of expensive act that gets into newspaper," like:

- Driving around London with a [fake "injured T. Rex" on the back of a flatbed truck](https://sketchevents.co.uk/project/t-rex-autopsy/)
- Dropping a [600lb block of ice](https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/26/wepay-ice-paypal/) outside a competitor's conference
- Assembling a 65,000 sq ft logo out of tiles so that it's [visible from space](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/25182/kfc-logo-you-can-see-space)

But the very way you work can be a bit of a stuntâ€”_worth talking about_, if not headline-worthy.

Like:

- A modern publisher having a [one-page website with nothing but a physical address](https://www.analogsea.com/)
- Making [1,000 pink cups](https://www.othersideceramics.com/collections/pink-cups)
- Sending an email every day ([many](https://jonathanstark.com/daily) [such](https://mail.flarn.com/mailman/listinfo/plura-list/) [cases](https://seths.blog/subscribe/))

Working on an ambitious project, or with an unusual constraint, gives people something interesting to share about you. "You have to send them a postcard to buy their books" vs "They publish books." "She's making 1,000 pink cups" vs "She makes ceramics." "He sends an email literally every day" vs "He writes about freelancing."

Give people something interesting to share about you, so they _seem like more interesting people_ when they talk about you, and ... people will talk about you. And as we all know, [word of mouth marketing](/word-of-mouth-marketing) is the higest form of marketing.

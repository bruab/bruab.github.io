I'm available to provide digital marketing services on a pro bono basis to organizations working to increase localized food production and consumption. Just [reach out](/contact), let me know what you're up to, and how  you think I can help.

## Why "localized food production"?

It's the thing I want to see more of in the world. 

I get that there are efficiencies and profits to be gained from centralizing where we grow, raise, and process what we eat. But my personal preference is to see people gardening (at home and in their communities), raising chickens, foraging, and caring for food forests.

If that's your thing, too, maybe we can work together.

## What services?

Mostly website stuff. I can help on the technical side or the strategic side. (You can read more about my qualifications [here](/work).)

We can start with an [audit](/audit) if you already have a website and it's a key part of your org's success. Or I can [advise and train](/coaching) folks on your team. Whatever, [let's talk](/contact) :)

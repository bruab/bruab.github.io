title: "Disastrous redesigns"
---

Here's an incomplete* list of website redesigns gone horribly awry.

- [Digg 2010](https://readwrite.com/2010/09/23/digg_redesign_tanks_traffic_down_26/) - Traffic down by 26% after launch
- [Marks and Spencer 2014](https://econsultancy.com/where-did-the-marks-spencer-website-relaunch-go-wrong/) - Sales drop by 8% immediately on launch, takes months to fix
- [Hertz 2018](https://www.theregister.com/2019/04/23/hertz_accenture_lawsuit/) - A $32M disaster that never launched
- [PubMed 2022](https://www.science.org/content/article/they-redesigned-pubmed-beloved-website-it-hasn-t-gone-over-well) - Users freak out on social media

Have you ever run any disastrous redesigns? Please [let me know](/contact). Maybe your story can save others from heartbreak.

\*_Incomplete because most companies manage to avoid public knowledge of the results of their redesigns. Or they don't even know the results themselves._ ðŸ™ƒ

Long before the tech hype cycle focused its attention on large language models generating [endless streams of boring-yet-convincing gibberish](/why-i-wont-use-ai), ordinary nerds were writing code to generate actually interesting stuff.

Here are a few of my favorite examples.

## Startups

Tiff Zhang's [Startup Generator](http://tiffzhang.com/startup/) is the best thing ever.

## Icebreakers

I made a [page](/icebreakers) that prompts you with an icebreaker for your boring zoom calls.

## Niche service offerings

I built a [niche generator](/niche-generator) to inspire service providers to focus their offering (and/or buy my $3 niche ebook).

## Fake names

Look no further than [fakenamegenerator.com](https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/).

## New age bullshit

Visit [this link](https://sebpearce.com/bullshit/) and click 'REIONIZE ELECTRONS'.

## LinkedIn broetry posts

Check out [Viral Post Generator](https://viralpostgenerator.taplio.com/). Total game changer. Thoughts?

## Farm names

If you refresh the [Farm name generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/farm-names.php) enough times, you'll probably see the name of my seeds 'n' starters business, Goosefoot Nursery.

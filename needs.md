Here's some stuff I could use help with. No pressure. (See also [Offers](/offers).)

## Book reviews on amazon dot com

Getting more reviews for my first book, [Your Website Sucks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7) is a top priority for me, as I seek to find out if there's any chance of making nontrivial income from it. If you feel so moved to buy a copy and leave an honest review, I'll be forever grateful.

## Alpha / beta readers for my book about criticism (or the next one)

There's no telling exactly what phase the book will be in as you read this, but I've almost always got something in need of feedback. Just [get in touch](/contact) and let me know you're available to help.

# Needs that have been met :)

## ~~Security advice~~

**Update:** A kind soul reached out and let me talk out my goals, offered some suggestions and reading recommendations, and after two brief exchanges I settled on a compromise that lets me stop paying for GSuite, do _almost_ everything locally, and strategically outsource the two functions (email and web hosting) that would involve the most effort and risk. Thanks AA!

~~I'm slowly but surely migrating off Google Suite, and that means handling more of my own data. At some point I'll migrate my GitHub Pages-hosted websites to a VPS. How do I go about this without exposing my data to clever haxxorz?~~

~~If you know about this stuff and are patient enough to answer some dumb questions, I'm sure it'd be of great use to me.~~

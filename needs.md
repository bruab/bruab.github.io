Here's some stuff I could use help with. No pressure. (See also [Offers](/offers).)

## Book reviews on amazon dot com

Getting more reviews for my first book, [Your Website Sucks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7) is a top priority for me, as I seek to find out if there's any chance of making nontrivial income from it. If you feel so moved to buy a copy and leave an honest review, I'll be forever grateful.

## Feedback on a short book about feelings

You can leave it here:

https://helpthisbook.com/briandavidhall/how-to-feel-your-feels

... or just [get in touch](/contact).

## Suggestions for artists, actors, directors, writers, and scientists to include in my book about criticism

You can get a feel for the tone of the book here:

https://onestar.world/

I'm looking to add about 20 more people. The loose criteria are:

- Self-evidently famous or successful in their field
- Ideally, not a dead white man (I've already written about lots of those)
- Subject to harsh criticism or setbacks during their career (Optional! I'm happy to do the research)

## Feedback on a short book about finding clients as a freelancer

You can leave it here:

https://helpthisbook.com/briandavidhall/your-first-three-clients

... or just [get in touch](/contact).

## Suggestions for podcasts I should appear on (or intros to hosts!)

I'm looking to promote four different books. So if you listen to, or just somehow know about a podcast on one of these topics:

- Criticism & creativity
- Freelancing/consulting
- Men and their (often repressed) emotions
- Website UX

... please please [get in touch](/contact). Or just leave an [anonymous suggestion](/anonymous-feedback).

## Suggestions for newsletters and other publications I should write for

Same topics as above! 

What do you read that you think might make a good home for an original, heartfelt article on any of these subjects? Or do you happen to be a writer/publisher who's open to a guest post or collaboration? Please do [reach out](/contact).

# Needs that have been met :)

## ~~Security advice~~

**Update:** A kind soul reached out and let me talk out my goals, offered some suggestions and reading recommendations, and after two brief exchanges I settled on a compromise that lets me stop paying for GSuite, do _almost_ everything locally, and strategically outsource the two functions (email and web hosting) that would involve the most effort and risk. Thanks AA!

~~I'm slowly but surely migrating off Google Suite, and that means handling more of my own data. At some point I'll migrate my GitHub Pages-hosted websites to a VPS. How do I go about this without exposing my data to clever haxxorz?~~

~~If you know about this stuff and are patient enough to answer some dumb questions, I'm sure it'd be of great use to me.~~

## ~~Alpha / beta readers for my book about criticism (or the next one)~~

**Update:** I've got plenty of folks on the list! Now I just need to revise my first draft.

~~There's no telling exactly what phase the book will be in as you read this, but I've almost always got something in need of feedback. Just [get in touch](/contact) and let me know you're available to help.~~

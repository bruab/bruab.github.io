title: Your first three clients
---

I want to help you find your first three clients. Why?

Because I'm working on a book titled _Your First Three Clients_, which will help people find their first three clients. But I can't in good faith write and sell the book unless I know it works.

So my plan is to coach at least a dozen humans through what I _hope_ is a low stress, repeatable method of client-getting. Find the gaps between what I think makes sense and what actually makes sense. You get clients, your clients get _you_, I get a better book, [win win win](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/seek-win-win-wins).

## What I'm offering

- **Strategy help** - Who are your clients, how can you find them, how should you approach them?
- **Templates and scripts** - No need to stare at a blank page when it's time to send a message or followup
- **Accountability** - Weekly-ish check-ins to help ensure you put in the work
- **Encouragement** - You don't necessarily _need_ a cheerleader, but surely it can't hurt

## How it works

- **Kickoff call on Zoom** - Outline your current situation, your goals, talk about any clients or leads you've already got
- **Async check-ins via SMS / Signal / Whatsapp** - I will check in on you proactively, hopefully that's not annoying
- **Ad hoc voice calls whenever helpful** - When you need to vent, or do a brain dump, or talk through a complex situation

If that sounds like something you might be into, just [send me a message](/contact) (or hit reply on any email I've ever sent you) and say something like "Hey let's see if you can help me find some clients."

## What's it cost?

Once my book comes out, I ask that you buy one copy for every client you've found. (It will be $19 paperback, $9.99 on Kindle.)

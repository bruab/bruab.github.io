title: Your first three clients
---

We (probably) don't know each other, but if you're thinking about freelancing, I want to help you find your first three clients. Why?

Because I want to write a book titled _Finding Your First Three Clients_, but I can't in good faith write and sell the book unless I know it works.

So my plan is to coach at least a dozen humans through what I _hope_ is a low stress, repeatable method of client-getting. Find the gaps between what I think makes sense and what actually makes sense. You get clients, your clients get _you_, I get a better book, [win win win](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/seek-win-win-wins).

If that sounds like something you might be into, please complete this exciting form:

title: Your first three clients
---

I want to help you find your first three clients. Why?

Because I want to write a book titled _Your First Three Clients_, but I can't in good faith write and sell the book unless I know it works.

So my plan is to coach at least a dozen humans through what I _hope_ is a low stress, repeatable method of client-getting. Find the gaps between what I think makes sense and what actually makes sense. You get clients, your clients get _you_, I get a better book, [win win win](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/seek-win-win-wins).

Here are the details:

- Group coaching calls every other Thursday at 12pm Eastern
  - 45 minutes
  - 2-10 attendees
  - Format:
    - 10 minute discussion on potential clients
    - 10 minute discussion on potential partners
    - 10 minute discussion on supporters 
    - 10 minute working session (send a message or two!)
    - 5 minute wrapup
  - Email support inbetween sessions

If that sounds like something you might be into, please complete this exciting form:

This is a [#nopitch](/nopitch) offer™. Once the second draft of the book is ready for beta reading, I'll start selling "early access + coaching calls + digital copy of the book when it's published." But if you opt in now, you get the whole package for free.

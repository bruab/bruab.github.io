title: Technology I love
---

I've been accused of being depressing in my attitudes toward new technology.

I can't control how other people feel when they hear my opinions, but I can certainly try to balance out my skepticism with some pure positivity. So here's a partial list, in rough chronological order, of the technologies I enjoy personally, and also see as having a net positive effect on humanity.

## Fire (~2 million years ago)

Good for staying warm, cooking food, 13/10 would discover again.

## Language (~200k years ago)

"[Great for solving problems / after it creates a problem](https://genius.com/8651679)"â€”okay, true, but come on. Nothing beats being able to express yourself to others, even if imperfectly.

Language gives us song, and jokes, and an efficient way to transmit knowledge generationally. I wouldn't want to live without it.

## Cheese (~7,000 years ago)

Okay so the stuff in the grocery store is produced in a way that's pretty terrible for cows, the atmosphere, and probably whoever eats it. Still, the basic concept of turning milk into tangy sustenance that keeps ... good stuff, I'm a fan. (Thanks @tw for the suggestion.)

## Writing (~6,000 years ago)

Spoken language gives us a way to connect with those around us, and to carry stories from generation to generation. But _written_ language goes so much further. It lets us learn from people far away from us in time and space, and the only limitation is how much time we can devote to reading. One of the best technologies ever.

## Soap (~5,000 years ago)

Highly underrated invention. It saves lives and makes us smell nice. I'm not sure if there is any downside to making and using soap. If you haven't tried it before, you should.

## Variolation (~900 years ago)

This early form of disease prevention is a [precursor to modern vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variolation). Helping avoid mass death and disablement is a great use for technology, I'm a fan. (Thanks @ja for the suggestion.)

## The printing press (~600 years ago)

Writing is only so valuable if it's so labor-intensive that most people can't afford reading materials. The technology that lets any old wacko publish any wild idea that comes into their head is a technology I'll always support. (Thank you for reading)

## The bicycle (~200 years ago)

Nothing against horses or walking, but I think bikes are the best method of transportation ever invented. Everyone who can ride a bike, should, and everyone who can't ride a bike should have the option of riding in a sidecar or trailer.

## The camera (~200 years ago)

If we didn't have a way to take cat photos, we could never have invented ...

## Indoor plumbing (~200 years ago)

Sanitation, convenience, can't beat it. (Thanks @tw for the suggestion.)

## Antibiotics (~100 years ago)

A huge win in the struggle againts bacterial infection. Of course the bacteria [have not given up](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378521/), but this invention sure put humans at an advantage.

## The Internet (~50 years ago)

I can't very well complain about the technology that brings these words to you, now can I? 

And I won't. It's full of horrors, but the internet helps connect us at a scale that boats and newspapers could never approach.

I've collaborated with people from all over the world, whom I've never met in person, and I love that.

## Linux (~30 years ago)

I'm a huge fan of the open source software project that powers most of the servers that bring you most of the internet. It's comprised of all sorts of handy tools for creating, editing, searching, organizing, and sharing text. You'll take my `grep` when you pry it from my cold, dead hands.

## Something's missing ðŸ¤”

This list came from looking around me and focusing on the things that bring me health, connection, and joy. But surely I left out a few items.

No pressure, but if there's something you suspect I omitted, feel free to suggest it here:

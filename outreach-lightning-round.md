Here's the agenda.

## (3 min) Hello and get ready

Welcome any newcomers, get your address book / contact list / LinkedIn connections open in front of you.

## (5-7 min) Someone who can hire you

Brainstorm a few names of [people who might, one day, theoretically, decide to hire you](https://yourfirstthreeclients.com/people-who-hire-freelancers/).

Such as:

- Former managers (or other higher-ups at places you've worked)
- Directors or higher at medium-to-large businesses
- Small business owners
- Agency leadership
- Freelancers who work on bigger projects and might subcontract out help

Pick one you wouldn't mind chatting with.

Figure out your message—maybe something like:

- Asking for advice
- Just checking in
- Getting help with a [research quest](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/quests-are-better-than-pitches)

[Send one message](https://yourfirstthreeclients.com/thoughtful-messages/).

## (5-7 min) A peer or partner

Brainstorm the names of a few people in your area of specialty, former colleagues, or freelancers in adjacent fields.

## (5-7 min) Someone who's rooting for you

Brainstorm the names of a few people who aren't potential clients, aren't colleagues, but still want to see you succeed.

Pick one you wouldn't mind chatting with.

Figure out your message—maybe something like:

- An update on your client search
- Asking if they know anyone in `{target industry}`

[Send one message](https://yourfirstthreeclients.com/thoughtful-messages/).

## (2min) Wrap up

Note any areas of resistance, hesitation to hit send, challenges over what to say. All this stuff is valid, and worth addressing.

Congratulate ourselves, say goodbye till next time.

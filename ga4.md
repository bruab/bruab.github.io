title: GA4 implementation and training

You've got 

{% include countdown.html date=1688169599 %}

... until your Google (Universal) Analytics property stops collecting data.

## Are you ready?

LOL of course not. It's okay though.

I can help you:

### Just get it done

Set up a bare bones GA4 installation so you'll have historical data when the deadline comes

### Explore alternatives to Google Analytics

Maybe it's time to consider another option? We should talk. (You'll notice there's no GA snippet on this site.)

### Do it right

I'll gather requirements from every analytics user on your team, and create a wishlist for the stuff you're not able to track right now.

Need BigQuery for data retention? No worries.

Want to send data to a European-based server to avoid issues with US-based data storage? Understood.

I'll build out a GA4 installation that's way better than your current setup, and train everyone on how to use it.

## The clock is ticking ⏰

Step one is to have a chat about:

- Your current analytics setup
- Which of the ☝️ above goals sounds most interesting, and 
- How much money you're looking to invest in analytics this year

Quick Zoom call. No sales pitch. 

You'll come away with a clear sense of your options and the project requirements, whether you decide to work with me or not.

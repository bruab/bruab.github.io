Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I used to have a calendar link here, but I found that keeping an open-to-the-public calendar link requires too much admin work. Setting hours, keeping the list of calendars up to date, blocking off busy days, etc.

Anyway, I'd still love to do a walk and talk! It will just require a couple of messages to schedule it. Please [get in touch](/contact) and we'll set something up.

In a perfect world, I'd spend at least one hour a day walking outdoors.

And in a perfect world, every time I go for a walk, I'd have a chat with an old (or new) friend.

Voice only, no screens, no hurry. Minimal agenda.

Exercising my brain and body at the same time, every day.

Sounds amazing. And to think, I could be living this dream if only I could find someone kind enough to book a call using the calendar below.

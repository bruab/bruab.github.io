title: About me

Where to begin? I live in rural Georgia with my [wife](https://www.othersideceramics.com/) and several [animals](/pets).

I look like this:

You can read about my [education](/education) and [work](/work) if you like. You can even read a list of [all the jobs I've ever had](/all-jobs).

My core belief is that all humans should have clean water, healthy food, cozy shelter, and enough free time to make [weird art](/weird-art). And that as long as people are going without those essentials, we all suffer.

If you share that belief and would like to collaborate on something, fantasticâ€”please [get in touch](/contact).

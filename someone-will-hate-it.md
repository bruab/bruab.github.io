Do you ever worry that if you share your work, somebody will mock and criticize you?

Well, you _should_ worry. Because they will.

The good news is that this puts you in some excellent company. Think Mozart, Marie Curie, Martin Luther King.

You can't avoid criticism, but you can remind yourself that it doesn't detract from how amazing you are.

And this newsletter can remind you, too.

Sign up and I'll send you a weekly update about what I'm working on, including articles about _undeniable geniuses_ being _absolutely dragged_ by critics, or peers, or random strangers, or all of the above.

I hope it will help you overcome your worry.

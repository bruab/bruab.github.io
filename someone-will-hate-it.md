Do you ever worry that if you share your work, somebody will mock and criticize you?

Well, you _should_ worry. Because they will.

The good news is that this puts you in some excellent company. Think Mozart, Marie Curie, Martin Luther King.

You can't avoid criticism, but you can remind yourself that it doesn't detract from how amazing you are.

The best way to do that is (surprise!) to buy my book on the topic, [One Star](https://onestar.world/).

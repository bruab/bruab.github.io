A book-in-progress that collects stories of great artists, performers, scholars and scientists being absolutely dragged by the public, or their critics, or their peers.

From Mozard to Marie Curie, nobody escapes doubt and criticism.

If they had to go through it, so will you.

If they survived it, so can you.

Each chapter is a quick inoculation against impostor syndrome, designed to help you share what you're working on, even if it's scary to do so.

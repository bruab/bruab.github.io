Do you ever worry that if you share your work, somebody will mock and criticize you?

Well, you _should_ worry. Because they will.

The good news is that this puts you in some excellent company. Think Mozart, Marie Curie, Martin Luther King.

You can't avoid criticism, but you can remind yourself that it doesn't make you less amazing.

And this newsletter can remind you, too.

Sign up and I'll send you a short post every month or so. 

Each post tells the story of an _undeniable genius_ being _absolutely dragged_ by critics, or peers, or random strangers, or all of the above.

I hope it will help you overcome your worry.

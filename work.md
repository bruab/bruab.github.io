Hi there! I'm flattered that you're curious about the work I do. Currently:

- I'm a partner at [Useful Books](https://www.usefulbooks.com/), where we help authors write recommendable nonfiction
- I'm writing a couple [books](/books) myself

In the past, I've done a ton of stuff, starting with "cook at Dairy Queen"â€”you can view a full list of all my jobs [here](/all-jobs). (Or you can look at a more traditional [resume](/resume.pdf).)

If you'd like to work with me, I'm even more flattered. You'll find more info [here](/work-with-me).

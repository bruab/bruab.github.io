Hi there! I'm flattered that you might want to work together (or that you're curious about the work I do).

I focus on website strategy + customer research. 

If you suspect your site could bring in more conversions than it does, and/or if you don't have a super clear picture of what motivates your customers to do business with you, I can probably help.

I'm not currently taking on new retainer clients, but I'd still love to meet, hear about your situation, and figure out how I can be of assistance - just [get in touch](/contact).

If you want to look at a proper resume, you can access it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WO-lOGfUrJxeeQIW9WpqR0xwUe0Yj5JF0oQKreFtyAI/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

If you want a list of all the jobs I've ever had, starting with "cook at Dairy Queen," check out [this thread](https://twitter.com/briandavidhall/status/1462188663425703938){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

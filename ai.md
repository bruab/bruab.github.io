I have never used, and [will not use](/why-i-wont-use-ai) large language model technology to generate text, audio, or video. Everything on this site was hand-typed by a human, always will be. Same goes for my books and emails.

If you're curious to know why, the post linked above tells part of the story. But I wrote that in January 2023, and these days I have ... more thoughts. Feel free to [reach out](/contact)!

(This page was inspired by the [/ai manifesto](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto) by Damola Morenikeji. Worth a read! And check out the footnotes.)

I host outcome-oriented working sessions for a random smattering of goals.

## [Work on your site](https://lu.ma/work-on-your-site)
For anybody whose website could use a little attention this week.

## [The Video Lounge coworking sessions](https://www.freelancefriday.club/events/video-lounge-coworking-sessions)
For folks who make videos - YouTubers, TikTokers, social media managers, online educators ...

## [Long game outreach club](https://lu.ma/long-game)
For freelancers who do thoughtful and consistent outreach.

(If you're not sure about this, you might like to read the [Long game outreach manifesto](/long-game-outreach-manifesto).)

## [Snowflake fiction pomodoros](https://lu.ma/fiction-pomodoros)
For amateur fiction authors.

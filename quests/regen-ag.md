Suppose you've decided that the future will need a lot more people growing food, and that this is Good, Actually.

It means less reliance on complex supply chains and fossil fuels for transportation, [less packaging](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/minimize-your-plastic-consumption), more people [in your area](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/keep-your-focus-local) working [outdoors](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/go-outside). It also gives you a chance to enjoy a variety of delicious [locally-produced foods](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/shop-locally) while supporting [businesses you feel good about](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/avoid-giving-money-to-people-organizations-or-causes-you-hate-if-you-can-help-it).

Cool, I agree. What should you do about it?

Grow tomatoes in containers? Volunteer at a local community garden? Buy a farm, or work on one? Start a nursery? Take a permaculture design course, or become an instructor? Lobby your local government to install edible landscapes? Start a compost co-op? Open a farm-to-table cafe?

What does the industry _need_? What's already working elsewhere that you could clone into your local community? What models are struggling, and what help do they needâ€”more labor, better legislation, a bigger market, what?

IDK either! I am on a quest to find out.

The culmination of this quest will be an exhaustive-as-possible map of the different businesses, government agencies, organizations, and DIY projects that contribute to increasing regenerative agriculture at the local level.

If I get fancy, I will make it searchable and filterable so you can easily find a fit for your budget, skill level, location, and interests.

To do this, I need to talk to people in the space. So if _you_ want to help, you can help me find them. 

Do you know an organic farmer, edible landscape designer, locavore restaurateur? Please [get in touch](/contact) and point me in their direction.

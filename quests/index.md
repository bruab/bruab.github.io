If you let me, I'll lecture you about how it's important to [go on quests](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/quests-are-better-than-pitches) and tell people about them.

Here's a list of _my_ current quests.

- [Sell 1,000 copies of my book](/marketing-your-website-sucks-book).
- [Create a guide to regenerative agriculture opportunities](/quests/regen-ag)
- [Be a guy who writes books for a living](/quests/write-books)

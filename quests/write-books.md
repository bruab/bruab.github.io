title: "Quest: Be a guy who writes books for a living"
---

A big part of publishing my [first book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7) was to check a box that says "wrote and published a book."

(Even before that, I published a smol [guide to B2B niches](https://gum.co/niche-list) in order to check a box that says "assembled and published a PDF.")

The book has its own mission, but it's part of a broader, longer term project to make writing my primary occupation.

I figure the best way to make this happen is to keep writing and publishing books, getting better at the process *and* developing a clearer picture of the overlap between stuff I want to write about and stuff people will buy books about.

You can help with this project by [buying my book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7), subscribing to my [newsletter](/newsletter), and hitting Reply once in a while to offer feedback or encouragement. Thank you.

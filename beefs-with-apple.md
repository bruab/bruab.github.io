title: Beefs with Apple
---

Here’s a partial list of reasons I'd like to stop using Apple. (See also [Beefs with Google](/beefs-with-google).)

## "They make great hardware!" ... and then deliberately degrade its performance

In case you missed it: Apple has been ordered to pay [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-to-pay-113-million-settlement-over-its-iphone-batterygate-slowdowns/) for the offense of secretly slowing down old iPhones. 


It's not clear to me who will benefit from this payout—I had one of the phones covered in the judgement but won't be holding my breath. I can say, though, that a few hundred million dollars isn't much of a penalty for a company that brings in [hundreds of _billions_ dollars a year](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/). To be clear: if you have $394.3 billion in revenue and you pay $113 million in fines ... you now have $394.1 billion.

## They lie about stuff

Apple admitted to slowing down phones to "improve user experience" after [denying it for years](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-slows-down-older-iphone-battery-issues/).

## They make terrible software

Macs are great. OSX is great. Everything else kinda sucks.

I've lost data multiple times trying to use iCloud backups. 

I once tried using Apple's Calendar program as a replacement for Google. I imported my GCals with just a few clicks, and then watched in horror as Calendar sent an invite for _every single event I had scheduled for the previous 3 years_. For weeks I was getting confused emails from friends and colleagues wondering why I invited them to attend a call that happened 18 months ago.

Their Family Sharing settings on the App store are so confusing I long ago gave up buying new apps, thoug apparently it's something that [five year olds are pretty good at](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2014/01/apple-inc-will-provide-full-consumer-refunds-least-325-million-settle-ftc-complaint-it-charged-kids).

## Their business model is centered on locking you in to good-enough options

This is an old story. Apple's been monopoly-chasing since [before the iPhone](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&article=1144&context=njtip). Their business flourishes when you buy their hardware, settle for their mediocre software, and spend money on their streaming services.

This is at odds with selling general-purpose computing machines, which technically can run any program and play any media file. Going with Apple means spending more money on a device that can do less stuff, period.

(As a practical example, try copying a .flac audio file from your Mac to your iPhone, and playing it. I have a computer science degree and I can't figure out how to do it. Frustrating enough to make you want to admit defeat and subscribe to Apple Music :)

## They lie about more stuff 

You know how you can tell your iPhone not to track you? [It doesn't listen](https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558).

## They may be doing price fixing

To be determined. More info [here](https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/apple-amazon-price-fixing).

# So what should you do?

I don't know! I'm going to try an Android phone running [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) as lately I find that my iPhone is slowing down—no doubt to "improve my user experience."

If you want to hear about how that's going, feel free to [get in touch](/contact).

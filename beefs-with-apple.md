title: Beefs with Apple
---

Here’s a partial list of reasons I'd like to stop using Apple. (See also [Beefs with Google](/beefs-with-google).)

## "They make great hardware!" 

It's true. BUT

## They deliberately degrade its performance ... and lie about it

In case you missed it: Apple has been ordered to pay [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-to-pay-113-million-settlement-over-its-iphone-batterygate-slowdowns/) for the offense of secretly slowing down old iPhones. Without admitting wrongdoing, after [denying the practice for years](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-slows-down-older-iphone-battery-issues/).

Maybe the fine means justice has been served. Or maybe a few hundred million dollars isn't much of a penalty for a company that brings in [hundreds of BILLIONS dollars a year](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/). To be clear: if you have $394.3 billion in revenue and you pay $113 million in fines ... you now have $394.1 billion.

## They make terrible software

Macs are great. OSX is great. Everything else kinda sucks.

Case in point: I've lost data multiple times trying to use iCloud backups. 

Case in point: I once tried using Apple's Calendar program as a replacement for Google. I imported my GCals with just a few clicks, and then watched in horror as Calendar sent an invite for _every single event I had scheduled for the previous 3 years_. For weeks I was getting confused emails from friends and colleagues wondering why I invited them to attend a call that happened 18 months ago.

Case in point: The Family settings on the App store are so confusing I simply gave up buying new apps. Though to be fair, it looks like something that [five year olds are pretty good at](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2014/01/apple-inc-will-provide-full-consumer-refunds-least-325-million-settle-ftc-complaint-it-charged-kids).

## Their business model is centered on locking you in to good-enough options

This is an old story. Apple's been monopoly-chasing since [before the iPhone](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&article=1144&context=njtip). Their business flourishes when you buy their hardware, settle for their mediocre software, and spend money on their streaming services.

This is at odds with selling general-purpose computing machines, which technically can run any program and play any media file. Going with Apple means spending more money on a device that can do less stuff, period.

(As a practical example, try copying a .flac audio file from your Mac to your iPhone, and playing it. I have a computer science degree and I can't figure out how to do this. Frustrating enough to make you want to admit defeat and subscribe to Apple Music :)

## They lie about more stuff 

You know how you can tell your iPhone not to track you? [It doesn't listen](https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558).

## They may be doing price fixing

To be determined. More info [here](https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/apple-amazon-price-fixing).

# So what should you do?

I don't know! I'm going to try an Android phone running [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) as lately I find that my iPhone is slowing down—no doubt to "improve my user experience."

If you want to hear about how that's going, feel free to [get in touch](/contact).

- Excerpts from books I'm working on (about [outreach](/long-game-outreach-manifesto), [dealing with criticism](/someone-will-hate-it), [epistemology](/we-dont-know-shit), and [freelance accounting](/you-have-to-learn-accounting-sorry).)
- New videos & podcasts
- Goings-on from the [meetups](/meetups) and events I host

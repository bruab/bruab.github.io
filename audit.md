Get a bite-sized, actionable dose of Conversion Rate Optimization in video format.

## How it works

- You answer a few questions about your site and visitors
- I'll take a look
- You get a video with 3-5 high impact, low effort suggestions
- ????
- Profit

## What it looks like

You’ll get a video & bullet points with suggestions & rationale.

It’ll contain everything you need to decide whether to act or not, and I’ll be available to supply everything your developer needs to implement the changes if you approve.

Here’s a sample video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ksr7z3jo_s0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can see more [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7q12E_LbqGqQaDE1n4UdZi596JUm9aWy).

Current turnaround time is one week.

## "Why should I bother?"
More revenue from the same traffic.

By removing friction, clarifying messaging, and improving usability on your site, you’ll get more leads (or purchases, or signups) from the visitors who are already coming to your site.

## "Who are you to judge my site?"

I’ve been doing Conversion Rate Optimization since 2015. Worked at top notch agencies like CROmetrics, FunnelEnvy, and Speero. Helped dozens of brands, like Udemy, General Assembly, L’Oreal, and Eventbrite.

I’ve run hundreds of experiments, and written over a [hundred blog posts](/categories/web-strategy/) on the topic. I think about this stuff all day.

I’ll condense everything I know about what visitors expect, what moves the needle, and what doesn’t cost an arm and a leg to implement, then package it up for you 🎁.

## "What does it cost?"

A website audit costs $250, paid up front.

## What it looks like

You‚Äôll get a video & bullet points with suggestions & rationale.

Current turnaround time is one week.

## "Why should I bother?"
More revenue from the same traffic.

By removing friction, clarifying messaging, and improving usability on your site, you‚Äôll get more leads (or purchases, or signups) from the visitors who are already coming to your site.

## "Who are you to judge my site?"

I‚Äôve been doing Conversion Rate Optimization since 2015. Worked at top notch agencies like CROmetrics, FunnelEnvy, and Speero. Helped dozens of brands, like Udemy, General Assembly, L‚ÄôOreal, and Eventbrite.

I‚Äôve run hundreds of experiments, and written over a [hundred blog posts](/categories/web-strategy/) on the topic. I think about this stuff all day.

I‚Äôll condense everything I know about what visitors expect, what moves the needle, and what doesn‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg to implement, then package it up for you üéÅ.

## "What does it cost?"

I've sold these audits for $300 in the past, but nowadays they're free / trade / donation optional. If you'd like one, just [get in touch](/contact).

## Brand sponsorship request

Here's the starting point for a message [Latasha James](https://latashajames.com/) used to secure a BRAND sponsorship deal.

_Hi `NAME`,_

_I hope you are doing well!_

_I've really valued our partnership over the past year or so, and have heard a ton of great feedback from my audience about their experience with `BRAND`, as well._

_I am currently preparing to launch the third round of my twice sold-out [Social Media Management Accelerator](https://courses.latashajames.com/courses/smma) program and wanted to touch base to see if you were open to additional partnership opportunities._

_The 8-week accelerator program sees up to 200 dedicated freelance social media managers each round and finishes off with a pitch competition streamed live to my [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/PRBSn-6g1ms?t=42m02s). We like to reward our 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners with some real-life prizes and thought a `BRAND` license would be an excellent fit for one or all of the winners. Is that something you would be open to sponsoring?_

_In addition to placement on the landing page, I'm also happy to offer a [video podcast read](https://youtu.be/1kLXdjv6t1Q?t=17m15s) promoting `BRAND`, as well as a dedicated lesson within the course content on using the tool itself._

_Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in exploring â€” happy to hop on a quick call to discuss further!_

_My best,_
_Latasha_

A few things to note:

- She already had a relationship with the recipients
- She asks for a specific contribution (a `BRAND` license)
- She's clear about what she's offering (course audience, YouTube stream, video podcast read, dedicated lesson) and provides supporting details
- She closes with a straightforward "yes or no" question

Hi, you've reached this page because I shared some sort of offer and decided it was important to emphasize that **there is no pitch at the end of it**. I am operating out of pure curiosity and a drive to be helpful.

I do pitch stuff sometimes! And sell services, and books. But it's important to me that I don't commercialize every aspect of my life.

And it changes things when we know, or suspect, that a pitch is coming. 

So I explicitly designate some projects, conversations, or offerings as `#nopitch`. Removing the mandate to profit and scale is a little treat I offer myself from time to time. You deserve the occasional treat, too.

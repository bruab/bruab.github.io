If you've bought (or borrowed, or pirated, or been gifted) this book:

... and left a review on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7), I'd like to offer you a free website help session.

_Especially_ if you're the person who left this review:

You can book your session here:

## Why are you doing this?

I decided a while back that [I just sell books](/i-just-sell-books), and I think this will help me sell books.

Partly because it's an incentive to buy (and review) my book! Partly because more reviews → more book sales.

And because—last but not least—putting generous, helpful vibes out into the universe _also_ helps me sell books. (Or so I assume.)

## What's it look like?

It's a casual 45 minute Zoom call. 

I can give UX or copy suggestions, talk through strategy, dig into analytics, help with technical stuff—whatever's helpful.

We can focus on your site, or designs for something new, or one of your clients' sites if you're a freelancer. You can gift this session to someone else if you'd like.

The one ⚠ is that I'll record and share the session for educational purposes. I don't expect there's a huge audience for such material, but there's probably _someone_ out there who will benefit from hearing how we reason about your challenges.

Hope to see you soon!

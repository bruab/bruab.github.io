Here's a quick audit of [Tom Kerwin's online course signup page](https://maven.com/tom-kerwin/innovate-confidently-with-pivot-triggers):

... and here are my notes:

- image - maybe convey who it's for? or pain
- rewrite tagline, focus on pain/transformation
- rewrite "Most ppl" (its good!)
- rewrite "This course" (tell a bit about what it's like)
- add formatting for who it's for
- "learn to read minds" ? "challenge ideas {adverb}" ?
- consider leaving out probes and pivot triggers
- "confusing signals" good!
- consider remove lauren's testimonial
- add note about who's already joined?
- add note about cohort size?

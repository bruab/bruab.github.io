... and here are my notes:

- 01:12 ❤️ product image in the homepage hero
- 01:39 CTA wording is confusing
- 03:02 Consider "foot in the door" easy first question
- 05:37 The + sign and fine print are a little distracting
- 07:10 Consider background design or imagery to deemphasize fine print
- 08:01 Consider changing password validation UI, or removing "Passwords match" warning until submit
- 09:56 Progress bar status unclear on first step - consider redesigning or removing it
- 10:25 Consider setting expectations / "you are here" messaging at the beginning of the funnel
- 12:39 Consider different options for images (including no images at all)
- 14:22 Test different "here's what you'll need" approaches - before account creation, after, none at all ...
- 16:00 Consider win back email for abandoned applications
- 16:37 Consider a tooltip or more context on how revenue data is used
- 18:04 Predictive search on the industry selector (?)
- 19:40 "Continue to application" is a confusing CTA
- 21:35 Maybe state explicitly that there are 2 stages of application, maybe merge into one ... maybe leave as is, who knows
- 22:34 Enable up and down arrows to select business address in suggestions dropdown
- 23:03 Explain advantage of adding social media accounts, or don't ask
- 24:35 Consider clarifying what "employee" means in LLC context
- 25:32 Consider "same as business address" option for owner home address
- 26:18 Clarify "tell us about your position" or change to "tell us your job title"
- 27:48 Weird behavior on accidental scroll (probably user error)
- 28:24 Add a message to clarify "we need info about your co-owners" maybe, or maybe I just got confused
- 28:48 Reword "control person" if possible, or don't ask if I'm the sole owner
- 30:13 ❤️ how the message updates during load screen
- 30:57 I got rejected :'(

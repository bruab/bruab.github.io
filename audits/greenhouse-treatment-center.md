... and here are my notes:

- Address top visitor priority above the fold
  - "Upscale" / "former spa"
  - Accepts insurance / possibly free
  - Success rate
  - Program specifics
- Offer
  - Productized offer ("personal treatment plan")
  - "Get info" option
- Images
  - "Edgy" vs wholesome
  - The center & amenities
  - Hugging family on the way out
- CTA
  - "Take control"
  - "Apply for treatment"
  - "Book a stay"
- Sticky footer
  - Remove expand/collapse and make buttons persistent
- Talking about pricing
  - Give a range?
  - Say "free for many patients" more prominently?
  - Add appropriate CTA to "How much does it cost?" FAQ (assuming enough visitors tap that FAQ)
- Self-select interaction
  - Alcohol, drugs or both?
  - Yourself or a loved one?
- About the Program page
  - Prioritize two or three key features without requiring interaction
  - Clarify whether visitor needs to choose program features, or if it's chosen for them, or the same for everyone
  - "Brand" the program - give it a name, call out key features and differentiators
- Check Your Insurance Form
  - Add "You'll need your insurance card handy" messaging
  - Clarify what happens after submit - do I find out right away or ?

*Not mentioned in the video but totally worth considering: Video prominence. I skipped over the video entirely - do visitors who watch it convert at a much higher rate? If so, try moving it higher up on the page, repeating it across pages

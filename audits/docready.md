... and here are my notes:

- 0:30 Assumptions: On mobile, via search
- 1:06 CTA is awesome 😍
- 1:43 Chat's in the way ... trigger after e.g. 15 seconds, or on scroll
- 3:43 Stock imagery doesn't help
- 4:53 Possible to break headline out into two landing pages? Urgent care vs primary?
- 5:55 Make price more visually prominent 
- 6:18 Reconsider third value prop ("No downloads")
- 7:17 Consider saying "No insurance required"
- 7:49 Add margin between bullet points and CTA
- 8:26 Consider "Talk to a doctor in minutes" instead of "No downloads"
- 8:53 Consider using "Call with doctor" image higher up in the page
- 10:25 Reword 3 steps - "Schedule appointment" / "See a doctor" / "Get treatment" ... if it fits
- 12:56 Bar charts unclear ... ask a designer to simplify (?)
- 14:24 Reviews are 😍 👍
- 15:22 Add some 4 star reviews to keep it real
- 16:17 Consider adding pediatrics (if that's a thing) 
- 18:32 Consider using chat widget to figure out what questions are holding visitors back
- 19:20 Kill the chat on pageload, lose the ratings widget
- 20:20 🤔 Figure out a concise (single, short sentence) way to sum up all the relevant treatment options
- 22:39 BONUS! 💥 Appointment flow
- 22:52 Kill the chat on pageload, lose the ratings widget
- 23:26 Lose "DocReady will see you now"
- 24:01 Move the timezone choices up, put them underneath Step 1
- 24:39 Reduce margins between buttons
- 25:39 Make Step 1 "Select your location" (Timezone and state)
- 26:01 Unclear if mental health, men's /women's health available

Here's a quick audit of [PIP Decks "Workshop Tactics" landing page](https://pipdecks.com/products/workshop-tactics):

... and here are my notes:

- design is beautiful
- maybe consider delaying the geolocation thing? idk
- consider self-identify opt-in
- consider lead magnet â†’ nurture as primary (or more prominent) CTA
- minor readability issues with hero section
- hard to read content on card screenshots - steal from the How It Works video?
- guarantee is hella strong
- consider scrapping the video for a static hero image

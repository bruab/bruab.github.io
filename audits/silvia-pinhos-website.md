Here's a quick audit of [Sílvia Pinho's online instructor website](https://www.thesilviapinho.com/):

... and here are my notes:

- "join us on the app" is unclear, consider removing
- great design + colors + energy
- "learn more" consider building to something more specific, idk what the offer is yet
- "click here" same note as above
- "level up your social media game" maybe, but maybe i'm confused and miserable?
- "clients on social media & upwork" some overlap, maybe unclear, can these be one offer?
- "trusted by" consider add labels and possibly "read case studies" CTA
- "clients on upwork" → "click here" → "start and grow online biz" slight mismatch to expectations, still dk the offer
- "how you can learn from me" - 3 ways, what's the recommendation?
- "skillshare" → nothing on upwork?
- upwork course LP is solid - action-oriented CTAs, emotional language, clear "who it's for" - good stuff

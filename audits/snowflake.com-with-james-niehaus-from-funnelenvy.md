... and here are my notes:

- 3:39 Avoid over-equipping the visitor with info
- 6:30 The dreaded carousel
- 7:11 Focus headline on positioning / benefit
- 10:01 "The hero's not gonna hit the mark on most of your (visitor) intent"
- 12:03 The "Why" page is your chance to sell
- 14:16 "Why" page above the fold is generic
- 18:24 Lead with your most compelling copy
- 19:05 "There's no close here"
- 21:04 Hero section tells visitors what's the most important thing on the page
- 21:57 "Click regret" on "tour" vs product tour
- 23:05 Find ways to meet different types of intent
- 28:38 "They're not guiding me down a path"
- 31:40 Ways to reach out are restrictive
- 32:45 I'd re-engineer the offers to make it easier to raise your hand
- 34:10 "You gotta feel the FOMO"
- 35:12 You can't rely on someone to consume all the content on each page
- 35:48 It's okay to repeat yourself :)

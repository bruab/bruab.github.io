... and here are my notes:

- 03:07 Don't hide or delete complaints on social
- 05:37 Just have one account per platform - not per location
- 06:17 Route all comments to a single email address
- 06:36 Route all complaints to a form on the website (off social)
- 07:56 Apologize and offer steps to resolve
- 08:22 Ideally have a team available 24/7
- 09:06 Establish a way to move complaints off social
- 10:08 When complaints come through on social you run the risk of them going viral
- 13:23 Navigation is overwhelming
- 13:41 Carousels are great for the company, not for the visitor
- 14:10 CTA could be bigger & more prominent
- 15:10 Does the visitor want to choose delivery vs shipping?
- 16:57 Just have two big buttons :)
- 17:45 Remove distractions during checkout
- 20:49 Possible to use location service to select a store?
- 22:40 Could we pick the cupcakes first and do the boring stuff afterward?
- 24:09 So many prepackaged assortments, maybe overwhelming?
- 24:34 ... including some that are not available (?)
- 25:17 Offer suggestions for sizes, e.g. 3/6/12?
- 26:18 Ask to choose random assortment OR pick your own
- 27:21 Possible to show the cupcakes without having to click each one?
- 29:29 Decorations options are a lot, do most visitors need this functionality?
- 33:03 Unclear where the special message will appear
- 33:41 Returning to "Build Order" after add to cart is a bit confusing
- 34:11 Need primary CTA (Checkout) after add to cart
- 37:38 Confirmation email is kind of impersonal
- 38:09 Confirmation email doesn't have the pickup address!
- 38:59 Quick recap

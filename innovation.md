Here are a few examples of human ingenuity being harnessed to maximize shareholder value.

## College textbooks ðŸ“š
Publishers release new editions every year, allowing them to raise prices even when the content barely changes. The result has been an [increase in cost of over 800%](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/college-textbook-prices-increase_n_2409153){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} in the past thirty years.

They also InNovAtE by offering a digital component with a unique access code, which [requires students to purchase the latest edition](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/01/why-students-are-still-spending-so-much-for-college-textbooks/551639/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} - and they've worked out agreements with schools to bundle the cost of books into tuition, so there's [no opportunity to opt out](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pajze9/people-are-finally-fighting-back-against-the-college-textbook-industrys-scam){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## Tax preparation software ðŸ’¼
TurboTax and H&R Block [invest in lobbying against simplification of the tax code](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/taxes/turbotax-h-r-block-spend-millions-lobbying-us-keep-doing-n736386){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to ensure that filing taxes is complicated enough to require their software.

This type of InNovAtioN ensures that the US does not join the [30+ nations with return-free tax filing](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-other-countries-use-return-free-filing){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} - and that the tax prep companies' shareholder value continues to increase.

## Tractors! ðŸšœ
John Deere [no longer sells tractors](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} - they sell a license to operate a tractor, which they can revoke, remotely, at any time.

This InNovAtioN serves their shareholders by enabling them to charge the same prices they've always charged (a tractor can cost more than half a million dollars), but retain ownership over their entire inventory.

I'd love to come on your podcast and give practical, industry-specific website strategy tips to your audience.

I wrote a book on this topic ([_Your Website Sucks, Here's How To Fix It_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7)), so of course I'm looking to plug that. But more importantly, I want to dive in to examples and edge cases specific to your listeners, and too specific to make it into the book. For photographers: _How do you balance page speed with the need to show off your work?_ For software startups: _How do you go beyond simply talking about features?_ For small farms: _Should you highlight your CSA or growing your newsletter? Can you do both?_

You can find links to previous interviews [here](/guest-spots). I've got a bio and some headshots [here](/media).

Here are some interview questions you can draw from:

- Your bio says you've run "hundreds of website experiments." What does that mean? What does it look like?
- Should everyone run experiments on their website? Should `$audience` be doing it?
- Should people use a website platform or build something custom?
- What are some common mistakes you see with `$audience` websites?
- What should be on the homepage?
- Should you have a chat widget / calendar link / coupons / popups on your site?
- What are some examples of _good_ `$audience` websites? What's good about them?
- What analytics should I pay attention to?
- What are some good resources on this topic?

That's it! Got questions, or want to set up a call? Just [reach out](/contact).

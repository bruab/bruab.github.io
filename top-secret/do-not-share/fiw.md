## Analyze your results

Watch this 9 minute video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aFLCutX8wWk?si=irb9aZUjnTGRJn9p" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For each question:

- Decide what counts as a correct answer
- Tag all correct answers
- Tag all incorrect answers

Note any interesting points of confusion, misinterpretations, or insights you get from the responses. Take these notes back to your team to discuss, or to your customers to explore.

Once you’ve coded all responses as “Got it” or “Didn’t get it” (possibly choosing to ignore some), calculate what percentage of testers Got it for each question.

## Decide what to do next

Watch this 3 minute video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSEHMiVQQD0?si=6E0_zepKNDBvxDBO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Now that you’ve got your results - specifically, the percentage of testers who **Got it** for each question ...

### Decide if you have a problem.

The [UsabilityHub guide to five second tests](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/five-second-testing) says:

> If more than around 80% of participants are in the first group, then you’ve got a successful design on your hands. If this number is much lower, then some changes are likely necessary.

How should you define “much lower,” though?

Here’s how I would think about it:

- **If more than 80% Got it:** Congratulations! You do not have a problem.
- **If 60-80% Got it:** Good enough. Note that there’s room to improve the page, and be sure you work to do so in the future. But it’s likely you have bigger opportunities elsewhere.
- **If fewer than 60% Got it:** You have a problem.

### If you have a problem

Take what you’ve learned from the “Didn’t get it” responses and brainstorm new elements for the page. Focus on the hero (topmost) section.

Work up a new combination of heading, body text, button, and (optional) image to convey what you sell, and to whom.

Then repeat the test with this new design.

### If you do not have a problem

That’s great! Your page is good, and you should feel good.

Hopefully you got some ideas worth exploring from reading through the responses.

Take those ideas and move on with life - remembering to re-test any future redesigns against this benchmark

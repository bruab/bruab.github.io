I'm old enough to have held a ton of jobs (full list [here](/all-jobs)), but at this point you probably don't want to hire me as a fry cook or kindergarten teacher. 

I'm most experienced, and probably most valuable, helping with **website strategy + customer research**. 

That could be anything from training and growing an experimentation team at an enterprise to helping a scrappy startup optimize their landing page copy. If you need analytics, A/B testing, or user research, we should talkâ€”you can get in touch by clicking this highly-optimized button:

_For the record_, website optimiztion isn't the only thing I do, and I'm open to hearing about whatever oddly-shaped project you might consider collaborating on. I'm in a phase of life where I value interesting opportunities and [work I actually feel good about](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/minimize-time-and-energy-spent-working-for-the-man) at least as highly as a paycheck, so if you've read this far, please do click the button.

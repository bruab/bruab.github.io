You can (and should!) take the fabulous [courses](/courses) I've put together, and read my amazing [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVSXB5W7). 

You can (and should!) also sign up for my ever-informative [newsletter](/newsletter), and stop by my [weekly website working sessions](https://lu.ma/work-on-your-site).

And if you have a specific question you think I can help with, you should literally just [email me](/contact). Really.

### "Yeah but I've got LOTS of questions"

In that case, you should consider booking me for web strategy coaching.

**$300 a month** gets you:

- One (1) hour-long Zoom call
- Email support inbetween calls

Here's what's in scope:

- Website strategy
- Conversion rate optimization
- UX design and research
- Copywriting
- Analytics
- Tagging and marketing tools
- A/B test strategy and implementation
- Anything else you think I can help with

We'll prioritize ruthlessly, make sure your data's not junk and your copy's not generic. We'll find the biggest opportunities and figure out how to go after them without overcomplicating things.

### "Hmm okay that might be helpful"

Great!

To get started, book a (free) 20 minute chat, come gripe about your website woes, and we'll decide if coaching is a fit for you.

title: Your first three clients—work in progress

Your first three clients will come as a natural consequence of research, outreach, conversations, and sharing.

## Research

You don't have an extensive portfolio of work to point to, so you'll start establishing your expertise by creating something valuable.

It will probably take one of two forms:

1. A report or guide that's unique and interesting to the people who hire folks who do what you do
2. A podcast (or similar guest-driven creative project) that features the people who hire folks who do what you do

## Outreach

Both of those options require talking to people! You'll do so, in a genuine but rigorous manner.

You'll keep track of who you've talked to, and about what. You'll follow up reliably.

You won't spam anybody, but you'll be patient and persistent.

## Conversations

The point of the outreach is not clicks or shares, but conversations. You'll ask people to talk to you. Some will ignore you, some will say no, but you'll be pleasantly surprised by how many say yes.

Along the way, you'll learn a lot of useful information about your trade, and the people you talk to will learn (a) what you do and (b) how smart and curious you are.

Some of these people will hire you, or refer you to someone who hires you.

## Sharing

As you begin to accrue knowledge and perspective from your conversations, you'll share what you're doing. This will beget more conversations, better research, easier outreach, and eventually ... clients.

# What you need to do

Starting right now, your priorities are to get clear on a couple things, choose a research quest, and cultivate a couple habits.

## Get clear on ...

- Who will hire you? What's their likely title if they're at a big company? How about at a smaller company?
- Why do they hire someone like you, and when? What are their past experiences with hiring and what expectations do they have about how you'll work (and what you'll charge)?
- What are some problems they're currently wrestling with, or open questions they're wondering about? This will help you ...

## Choose a research quest

If you have no strong preference between starting a podcast or writing a report, choose the latter. It's easier.

If you already have a podcast, or podcasting skills, or if it sounds super fun to you, choose that.

Either way, you need to design the thing you're creating to be interesting to the people who will hire you. It's possible I can help with that (see below).

## Cultivate habits

- Reaching out to people and following up—consistently and without being pushy
- Steering conversations in the direction of people's goals, frustrations, and most pressing problems

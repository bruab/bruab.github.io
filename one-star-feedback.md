Thanks again for letting me send you a shoddy prototype of a book!

Here are a few of the open questions I'm pondering. Feel free to respond to them, or share literally anything else you're thinking, in the form below.

(The form is anonymous, but you're welcome to include your name so I can thank you again :)

- Choice of profiles
  - Anybody who doesn't belong? 
  - I plan to add ~50 more, anybody I should make sure to include?
- Page structure / info included
  - Should I explicitly indicate "category" (art/lit/music/film)?
  - Do the "no quotes, just bullets" pages work?
  - Do the "quote _and_ bullet(s)" pages work?
- Front matter / back matter
  - The plan is to write a short (~1 page) intro, anything I specifically need to explain?
  - I figure I'll just add citations at the end, anything else? An index of some sort, categorization of the types of criticism?

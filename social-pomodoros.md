I host a weekly coworking session, every Tuesday at 12pm US-Eastern.

We take a few minutes to check in, then spend 30 minutes heads down, writing/editing/organizing or doing whatever One Thing we most need to focus on.

Then we take a few more minutes to share our results.

Doesn't sound like much, but it's ü¶Ñmagical‚ú®. Even [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/fac_development/career-path/wags.html) says so.

If you'd like to drop by, [register here](https://lu.ma/social-pomodoro).

Hope to see you soon!

I host coworking sessions, every Tues / Weds / Thurs at 12pm US-Eastern, on Gather.

We take a few minutes to check in, then spend 40 minutes heads down, writing/editing/organizing or doing whatever One Thing we most need to focus on.

Then we take a few more minutes to share our results.

Doesn't sound like much, but it's ü¶Ñmagical‚ú®. Even [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/fac_development/career-path/wags.html) says so.

You can join [here](https://app.gather.town/app/zEYQ6kmdXJt8SKBb/forest). (The Gather space is open 24/7. If you get there before me, feel free to explore.)

Hope to see you soon!

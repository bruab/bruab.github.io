I host a weekly coworking session, every Tuesday at 11am US-Central.

We take a few minutes to catch up, then spend 30 minutes heads down, writing/editing/organizing or doing whatever One Thing we most need to focus on.

Then we take a few more minutes to check in and share our results.

Doesn't sound like much, but it's ü¶Ñmagical‚ú®. Even [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/fac_development/career-path/wags.html) says so.

If you'd like to drop by, [click here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19iOTQ4OWYyOTNlNjUyODA4ZWZlZDdmMzQzZmU4ZDczZGU5N2RkZTdhZmJlNGNlYzhkMmMzNTRkNmIxM2IxNmUwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) to access the calendar, and add them to your Google (or other) Calendar app.

Or just [reach out](/contact) for the meeting details.

Hope to see you soon!
